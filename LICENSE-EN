#   In case someone use my subtitle which makes me unhappy. An inspiration from two things:
#
#     1. The translation of the 8-bit-guy videos was originally by Woodear85@Bilibli
#        (now paizhangpi@Bilibili) with the permisson of David Murray, original producer of the
#        8-bit-guy videos. In the mid May 2020, a subtitle group take over the translation of
#        the 8-bit-guy videos with the permisson of David Murray (I think he had forgot he have
#        gave a permission to somebody). The quality of the translation was very terrible due to
#        heavy use of the machine translation. Some fans dislike the new translation group and
#        after some discussion between Woodear85, the new translation group, and David Murray, the
#        permission has transfered back to Woodear85.
#
#     2. The Chubbyemu videos (produced by Dr. Bernard Hsu) are translated by the "C7 translation
#        group(第七颈椎字幕组)", estabished by David_lai(who controlled the original Bilibili branch
#        of the Chubbyemu channed, called RealChubbyemu). During the beginning of 2021, David_lai
#        forbade everyone in the C7 subtitle group and Dr. Hsu accessing the RealChubbyemu account.
#        And take the money in the RealChubbyemu account away. Now Dr. Hsu premitted C7 subtitle
#        group to translate Chubbyemu video and publish them in the new Bilibili branch.
#
#    I would not gain anything from making these subtitles, but I also don't want them fall into
#    the wrong hand. And also, I don't have much time deal with permission and money-related things.
#    So when I successfully contact Clint Basigner(LGR) himself, I didn't ask for permission, but a
#    open cheque instead.
