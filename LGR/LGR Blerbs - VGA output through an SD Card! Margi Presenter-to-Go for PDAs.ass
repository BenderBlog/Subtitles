Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.16,0:00:07.26,English,,0,0,0,,This is the margie... margie... emm I don't know.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.26,0:00:12.52,English,,0,0,0,,Presenter-to-Go SD Card VGA Output thingy.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.88,0:00:15.26,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah, this is, uh, something that y'all let me know about
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.26,0:00:19.60,English,,0,0,0,,when I did my video on the HP iPAQ Pocket Camera.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.60,0:00:20.88,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah,(I) did a video on that.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.88,0:00:24.60,English,,0,0,0,,Digital camera that goes into an SDIO card slot interface
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.60,0:00:26.72,English,,0,0,0,,and Pocket PCs and PDAs.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.72,0:00:31.27,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah, I've got this here that I'm going to try this with because
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.27,0:00:34.10,English,,0,0,0,,I had never heard of this until some of y'all left some comments.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.10,0:00:37.36,English,,0,0,0,,And check it out. It's just a VGA output dongle thing
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.36,0:00:43.24,English,,0,0,0,,that plugs into the SD card slot, to really, SDIO slot there.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.95,0:00:47.21,English,,0,0,0,,And gives a VGA output of some emm... kind.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.51,0:00:53.03,English,,0,0,0,,But I don't know, I didn't actually see this iPAQ listed
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.03,0:00:55.37,English,,0,0,0,,as something that it would work with specifically.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.37,0:00:57.00,English,,0,0,0,,But, that kind of makes sense.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.00,0:01:00.23,English,,0,0,0,,This predates, this particular iPAQ model.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.23,0:01:02.78,English,,0,0,0,,Seems like it should though. The requirements aren't...
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.78,0:01:06.06,English,,0,0,0,,I don't know, too particular? It just says you need
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.06,0:01:08.78,English,,0,0,0,,A Pocket PC handheld from the supported list and...
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.36,0:01:10.40,English,,0,0,0,,Like I said, it's not on there.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.40,0:01:13.70,English,,0,0,0,,So anyway, let's just go ahead and (voice stuck) and open it up.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.52,0:01:20.40,English,,0,0,0,,And this is kind of cool.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.66,0:01:24.80,English,,0,0,0,,So you got this nice little carrying pouch here.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.80,0:01:26.00,English,,0,0,0,,We'll open that up.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.52,0:01:30.24,English,,0,0,0,,It does smell leathery. It's actually kind of nice.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.50,0:01:34.66,English,,0,0,0,,It got that new car kind of a degradation smell.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.04,0:01:38.84,English,,0,0,0,,It's like certain materials they degrade and they smell like a new car.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.84,0:01:42.64,English,,0,0,0,,Anyway, I got a CD-ROM here with the software
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.64,0:01:44.34,English,,0,0,0,,so this is just a windows side of things.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.68,0:01:47.02,English,,0,0,0,,I've already installed this on my Windows XP machine.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.02,0:01:52.02,English,,0,0,0,,And got it transferred over like the the file that it needs onto the Pocket PC.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.02,0:01:52.96,English,,0,0,0,,So it's on there, ready to go.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.14,0:01:56.80,English,,0,0,0,,And we got this right here, which is again, extremely basic.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.66,0:01:59.66,English,,0,0,0,,I think this is pretty much it. You get in English.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.28,0:02:03.10,English,,0,0,0,,It's just like, uh... yeah, plug it in (to) use it.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.06,0:02:07.62,English,,0,0,0,,The complete user manual is available on the CD.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.39,0:02:14.42,English,,0,0,0,,And yeah, it also has a PowerPoint tutorial on the CD as well
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.42,0:02:18.56,English,,0,0,0,,that you can look at to see how to use it.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.84,0:02:22.10,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah, everything else is just in other languages,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.72,0:02:23.50,English,,0,0,0,,So this is all you get.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.64,0:02:27.92,English,,0,0,0,,And it is pretty fitting that it comes with a
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.92,0:02:30.16,English,,0,0,0,,tutorial in PowerPoint presentation form.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.16,0:02:35.86,English,,0,0,0,,Because this really is built for on-the-go PowerPoint presentations.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.48,0:02:40.70,English,,0,0,0,,So if you had your PDA, and your PowerPoint on there ready to go back in the day,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.44,0:02:47.84,English,,0,0,0,,then there you go, and it's got this margie...8-(
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.84,0:02:50.96,English,,0,0,0,,Anyway, you got this mirror application.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.02,0:02:56.12,English,,0,0,0,,So, let's get this unpacked and run that.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.92,0:03:02.48,English,,0,0,0,,And... Yeah, like I said, sort of built for PowerPoint presentations,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.48,0:03:04.68,English,,0,0,0,,some slide show type of stuff.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.68,0:03:07.54,English,,0,0,0,,And that kind of has me thinking that
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.54,0:03:12.38,English,,0,0,0,,maybe it won't be exactly VGA output that's very live.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.70,0:03:14.60,English,,0,0,0,,I don't know. Like I said, I haven't really tested it yet.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.60,0:03:17.06,English,,0,0,0,,I've just... I have turned it on, that's about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.92,0:03:20.18,English,,0,0,0,,So you've got the little dongle in here...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.78,0:03:23.66,English,,0,0,0,,and you got VGA out on that side.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.28,0:03:27.70,English,,0,0,0,,And then the little SDIO interface part right there.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.16,0:03:33.94,English,,0,0,0,,And then, of course, that just goes in... like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.30,0:03:38.22,English,,0,0,0,,And it's got the same issue where it's just going to slide right out,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.22,0:03:42.76,English,,0,0,0,,with no problem, because SD card slots were meant to
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.76,0:03:44.71,English,,0,0,0,,have things inserted in there and
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.71,0:03:47.04,English,,0,0,0,,they don't really hold on to things that are in there.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.77,0:03:51.06,English,,0,0,0,,So anyway, that's the thing.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.11,0:03:54.40,English,,0,0,0,,So you got to be careful with it.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.40,0:03:57.46,English,,0,0,0,,And it's got a VGA cable here, just a little short one.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.73,0:03:59.91,English,,0,0,0,,I don't know, foot long or something.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.87,0:04:05.44,English,,0,0,0,,There's a... a remote? I guess that's what the little things are for on the sides
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.44,0:04:08.34,English,,0,0,0,,like IR sensors. Check that out.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.62,0:04:11.65,English,,0,0,0,,Again, made for PowerPoint presentations.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.65,0:04:13.94,English,,0,0,0,,You know, moving slides forward and backward.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.19,0:04:17.77,English,,0,0,0,,And I'm assuming they interface with certain programs or... something.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.40,0:04:26.22,English,,0,0,0,,And... it does require external power.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.44,0:04:31.80,English,,0,0,0,,So you have this little thing right here, that is...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.62,0:04:38.80,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah, those 5V 600mA, 0.1A input.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.00,0:04:42.49,English,,0,0,0,,So that plugs into the back of the dongle,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.94,0:04:44.32,English,,0,0,0,,and get this back out of here.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.68,0:04:48.66,English,,0,0,0,,So it's really not the most elegant solution,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.66,0:04:52.86,English,,0,0,0,,but it does the trick if you need VGA output on the PDA.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.86,0:04:53.66,English,,0,0,0,,There you get (it) go.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.46,0:04:56.17,English,,0,0,0,,I mean, this is pretty cool.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.17,0:04:59.41,English,,0,0,0,,Like the whole idea of having VGA output of ANY KIND...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.80,0:05:02.26,English,,0,0,0,,on a PDA is just fantastic.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.26,0:05:03.24,English,,0,0,0,,You know, much less.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.08,0:05:06.31,English,,0,0,0,,Through the SD card slider, SDIO.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.15,0:05:08.50,English,,0,0,0,,This is so cool.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.83,0:05:11.41,English,,0,0,0,,Uh, anyway, let's test it out!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.05,0:05:16.88,English,,0,0,0,,Okay, I got a CRT here. VGA cable just going to plug that in...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.06,0:05:21.48,English,,0,0,0,,to a little box. And I got power going to that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.76,0:05:25.60,English,,0,0,0,,And then the PDA, just plug it in.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.36,0:05:35.64,English,,0,0,0,,And it immediately switches over to the output of the box
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.64,0:05:38.18,English,,0,0,0,,which is just a blank screen by default.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.61,0:05:43.42,English,,0,0,0,,So if we open up the Margie application: Margie Mirror.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.07,0:05:47.86,English,,0,0,0,,We can see that we've got some options there
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.86,0:05:51.64,English,,0,0,0,,in terms of enabling it, zooming it, updating and rotating.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.64,0:05:53.20,English,,0,0,0,,So let's just enable.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.04,0:05:59.91,English,,0,0,0,,(Chuckle) Look at that! Oh man.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.91,0:06:02.72,English,,0,0,0,,That is a fantastically sharp image.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.92,0:06:06.52,English,,0,0,0,,See that is zoomed. There's that.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.17,0:06:11.20,English,,0,0,0,,So that's as zoomed in as they can go,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.20,0:06:14.25,English,,0,0,0,,but still, that is awesome.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.38,0:06:17.27,English,,0,0,0,,Let's see what we're dealing with here.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.47,0:06:19.83,English,,0,0,0,,Sixty hertz, oh yeah, that's right.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.83,0:06:22.68,English,,0,0,0,,(However), this one doesn't show the the resolution.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.31,0:06:29.04,English,,0,0,0,,Well it is 60 hertz, so let's change the updated speed. I'm not sure...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.80,0:06:32.60,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah it's still going to do this.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.12,0:06:34.88,English,,0,0,0,,You know, obviously it's not in real time.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.88,0:06:38.04,English,,0,0,0,,I think what it's doing is taking a screen shot.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.44,0:06:43.17,English,,0,0,0,,And then, like buffering it in here, maybe transferring it to the
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.17,0:06:48.06,English,,0,0,0,,SD card... storage? Maybe? I don't really know if there's storage, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.82,0:06:53.60,English,,0,0,0,,Obviously it takes a little bit to render out on the screen.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.85,0:06:58.14,English,,0,0,0,,I do like that you can rotate as well. That's pretty handy.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.74,0:06:59.60,English,,0,0,0,,At least it could be.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.11,0:07:04.68,English,,0,0,0,,But yeah, it's effectively just showing a static... image.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.68,0:07:11.02,English,,0,0,0,,And that's it. So it's not really a complete, uh, like screen sharing type of thing.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.28,0:07:17.74,English,,0,0,0,,Now I guess this is a game that I was... playing previously.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.88,0:07:29.77,English,,0,0,0,,Interesting... It is actually updating faster
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.77,0:07:32.16,English,,0,0,0,,when it's on solitaire, isn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.80,0:07:38.04,English,,0,0,0,,It's yeah, okay. That's quicker, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.56,0:07:45.04,English,,0,0,0,,[Laughter] obviously still not real time.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.36,0:07:49.45,English,,0,0,0,,This is fascinating, man. I don't really know what it's doing exactly.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.61,0:07:55.63,English,,0,0,0,,It does seem to be that, the more stuff is on screen to refresh, the slower it is.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.29,0:08:00.75,English,,0,0,0,,So maybe it is trying to figure out what it sees
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.56,0:08:05.58,English,,0,0,0,,as being different and then, only updating that part of the screen.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.80,0:08:09.24,English,,0,0,0,,I don't know, but this is neat.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.24,0:08:13.23,English,,0,0,0,,[Chuckle]Even if it's not a direct video feed.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.15,0:08:21.66,English,,0,0,0,,I don't know, man. I don't know how it's exactly doing it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.79,0:08:24.47,English,,0,0,0,,Anyway, that's pretty much what this is.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.47,0:08:26.31,English,,0,0,0,,It's kind of awesome at the same time,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.31,0:08:28.73,English,,0,0,0,,though, it's just, yeah, very very slow.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.84,0:08:32.86,English,,0,0,0,,But nothing else. It provides an easy way to very quickly get screen shots
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.86,0:08:39.20,English,,0,0,0,,instead of having to, you know, use something within the Pocket PC itself to take a screen shot.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.37,0:08:43.82,English,,0,0,0,,Like I can have this directly connected to... a capture device over there.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.00,0:08:46.24,English,,0,0,0,,In fact, let me go ahead and do that right now. I'll just switch over...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.24,0:08:48.11,English,,0,0,0,,To some capture device footage.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.82,0:08:53.26,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah. I mean, you can capture directly from a PDA like this.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.69,0:08:58.27,English,,0,0,0,,It's just very slow, so it's not going to be good for capturing any kind of game-play.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.27,0:09:02.05,English,,0,0,0,,But, you can see how this would be fantastic for presentations on the go.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.41,0:09:05.95,English,,0,0,0,,PowerPoint things and any kind of, you know, even photos, slide shows.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:06.45,0:09:10.82,English,,0,0,0,,That's just... I can see this being highly appealing to business users.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.82,0:09:14.62,English,,0,0,0,,And yeah, even folks that just want to bore people with their vacation pictures.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.83,0:09:17.29,English,,0,0,0,,Why not? Especially if you have a little camera add-on too.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:18.24,0:09:21.22,English,,0,0,0,,Oh, before we go and one last thing here, got the remote.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.40,0:09:24.40,English,,0,0,0,,I wanted to try this out and see... maybe how this worked.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.40,0:09:27.72,English,,0,0,0,,I believe it's just for switching through slides and PowerPoint whatnot.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:27.72,0:09:31.66,English,,0,0,0,,But uh, unfortunately, check that out.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.28,0:09:34.20,English,,0,0,0,,You got a corroded little battery in there.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.70,0:09:41.26,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah, don't see those corrode, terribly often, but it did.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.78,0:09:48.42,English,,0,0,0,,This is a... CR2025, I don't have one of these, another one.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.42,0:09:51.14,English,,0,0,0,,So I'm not able to test this right now.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.80,0:09:54.12,English,,0,0,0,,So I don't even know if it would do anything.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.96,0:00:04.16,Chinese,,0,0,0,,大家好啊，我给大家说说这个东西
Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.16,0:00:12.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这是个Margi牌的便携式VGA输出装置，用的是SD卡接口
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.88,0:00:15.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我上期做惠普iPAQ移动相机视频时
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.26,0:00:19.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你们就不停地向我安利这个了
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.60,0:00:20.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,没错，我上个视频已经说过了
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.88,0:00:23.09,Chinese,,0,0,0,,给掌上电脑和PDA设计的
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.09,0:00:26.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,通过SD卡接口连接的数码相机
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.88,0:00:26.72,Comments,,0,0,0,,注：BV1Wz4y1S7fY 惠普掌机式移动相机 @ LGR & wu_dl
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.72,0:00:31.27,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在为了体验一下这个，我把iPAQ又拿出来了
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.27,0:00:34.10,Chinese,,0,0,0,,要不是观众老爷在评论区说的话，我还不知道呢
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.10,0:00:37.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个就是一个插在SD卡接口上的
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.36,0:00:43.24,Chinese,,0,0,0,,更准确地说，插在SDIO接口上的VGA输出适配器
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.36,0:00:43.24,Comments,,0,0,0,,注：SD插槽只能接存储卡，而SDIO插槽可以接各种设备，诸如GPS设备，相机等
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.95,0:00:47.21,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后输出一些VGA信号
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.51,0:00:53.03,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过我有点没底，我看包装上没有写
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.03,0:00:55.37,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个能100%适配我这个机器
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.37,0:00:57.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过，这也能理解
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.00,0:01:00.23,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个比那台iPAQ的发售日期早
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.23,0:01:05.20,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我觉得应该行，硬件要求也不太具体
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.20,0:01:08.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,盒子上说，只要你的设备在支持列表上就能用
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.36,0:01:10.40,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然而我的没在上面
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.40,0:01:13.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,无论如何，赶紧开个箱
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.52,0:01:20.40,Chinese,,0,0,0,,有点意思哈
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.66,0:01:24.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这有个十分耐人的小包
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.80,0:01:26.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,一会再打开
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.52,0:01:30.24,Chinese,,0,0,0,,闻上去是皮革的，挺用心的
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.50,0:01:34.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这种老化的味道跟新车的味道一样
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.04,0:01:38.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,就是说，某种材质老化了，然后散发出新车的味道
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.84,0:01:42.64,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后这里有CD，里面装着软件
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.64,0:01:44.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以这跟电脑就有关了
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.68,0:01:47.02,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我已经将其装在了XP古董机上
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.02,0:01:52.02,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后将必要的文件都传送到了iPAQ上
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.02,0:01:52.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在万事具备，只欠东风
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.14,0:01:56.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我还翻到了这个，十分普通的说明书
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.66,0:01:59.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,估计就这点东西吧，这是英文那页的
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.28,0:02:03.10,Chinese,,0,0,0,,一句话：插上去开始用
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.06,0:02:07.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,完整版说明书在CD上
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.39,0:02:14.42,Chinese,,0,0,0,,CD上还有PPT版教程
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.42,0:02:18.56,Chinese,,0,0,0,,看完PPT，你就明白怎么用了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.84,0:02:22.10,Chinese,,0,0,0,,剩下的语言我全部不认识
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.72,0:02:23.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以我就介绍到此了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.64,0:02:27.92,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个东西附带一个PPT展示
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.92,0:02:30.16,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我觉得还挺好的
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.16,0:02:35.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因为它就是用来很方便地投射PDA上的PPT的
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.48,0:02:40.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,如果你那时有PDA，并且里面还有PPT的话
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.44,0:02:47.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,接上后要用这个叫Maggie.....（迷惑读音
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.84,0:02:50.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,反正用这个投影程序就行了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.02,0:02:56.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以说，我们来拿出那个神秘的设备吧
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.92,0:03:02.48,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我刚说过，这个是用来演示PPT
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.48,0:03:04.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,或是某种幻灯片啥的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.68,0:03:07.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这让我想到了
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.54,0:03:12.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,也许它的VGA信号输出不是实时的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.70,0:03:14.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然而我还没试，所以我也说不好
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.60,0:03:17.06,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我刚才只是将机器启动了一下
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.92,0:03:20.18,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在给大家展示的就是适配器了
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.78,0:03:23.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这边是VGA输出接口
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.28,0:03:27.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个是要插入SDIO接口的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.16,0:03:33.94,Chinese,,0,0,0,,至于怎么插进去，不用多说了吧
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.30,0:03:38.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而这个和那个摄像头一样，容易滑出来
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.22,0:03:42.76,Chinese,,0,0,0,,也好理解，因为SD卡槽本身设计是
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.76,0:03:44.71,Chinese,,0,0,0,,将东西完全插进里面的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.71,0:03:47.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而像这种有外置的东西就接不住了
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.77,0:03:54.40,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以说，你只好小心点了
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.40,0:03:57.46,Chinese,,0,0,0,,本身还附带了一条VGA线缆，挺短的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.73,0:03:59.91,Chinese,,0,0,0,,也就一英尺长吧
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.87,0:04:05.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,还有个遥控器，估计转接盒侧面的小玩意
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.44,0:04:08.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,就是个红外线传感器吧
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.62,0:04:11.65,Chinese,,0,0,0,,毕竟是用来放PPT的
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.65,0:04:13.94,Chinese,,0,0,0,,也就是向前向后翻一页
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.19,0:04:17.77,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我觉得这个应该有个配套程序吧
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.40,0:04:26.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而且，这个转接器还要用外置电源
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.44,0:04:31.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,就是这个大家喜闻乐见的玩意啦
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.62,0:04:38.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,5V*600mA=3W, 输入电流0.1A
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.00,0:04:42.49,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个要插入转接器的后面
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.94,0:04:44.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而那个就要要插进插座了
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.68,0:04:48.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以我说这个没那么优雅
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.66,0:04:52.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但如果你需要将PDA里的东西用VGA输出的话
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.86,0:04:53.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你只能用这个了
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.46,0:04:56.17,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个确实很酷
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.17,0:05:02.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,只要将PDA里的东西用VGA输出的话，就挺先进的
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.26,0:05:03.24,Chinese,,0,0,0,,就用这些东西（不是
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.08,0:05:06.31,Chinese,,0,0,0,,插进SD接口，通过SDIO输出
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.15,0:05:08.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,听上去就挺高大上
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.83,0:05:11.41,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在赶紧测试吧
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.05,0:05:16.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好的，CRT显示器已经准备好了，VGA接口正准备接入
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.06,0:05:21.48,Chinese,,0,0,0,,转接器也接好电了
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.76,0:05:25.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在我把其接入PDA
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.36,0:05:35.64,Chinese,,0,0,0,,立马转接器的信号就输出了
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.64,0:05:38.18,Chinese,,0,0,0,,默认是个白屏，啥也没有
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.61,0:05:43.42,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在我将投影软件Margie Mirror打开
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.07,0:05:47.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这里有些选项
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.86,0:05:51.64,Chinese,,0,0,0,,包括开启，放大，刷新频率和旋转屏幕
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.64,0:05:53.20,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在咱启动吧
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.04,0:05:59.91,Chinese,,0,0,0,,快看看，快看看啊╰(*°▽°*)╯
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.91,0:06:02.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,图像锐利得简直是不得了
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.92,0:06:06.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在我把放大功能给关了
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.17,0:06:14.25,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这就是放大功能了，确实挺好
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.38,0:06:17.27,Chinese,,0,0,0,,看看目前的输出情况吧
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.47,0:06:19.83,Chinese,,0,0,0,,60Hz，确实是这样
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.83,0:06:22.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然而它没有显示分辨率
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.31,0:06:29.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,目前是60Hz刷新率，现在我把刷新频率调高些，然后就
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.80,0:06:32.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好吧，一点都没变
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.12,0:06:34.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,显然，这个不是实时刷新的
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.88,0:06:38.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我觉得转接器得先截个图
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.44,0:06:43.17,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后缓冲到屏幕上，也许先将其传送至
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.17,0:06:48.06,Chinese,,0,0,0,,SD卡上的存储设备......这上面真有存储设备吗？
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.82,0:06:53.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,反正渲染显示得花点时间啦:-|
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.85,0:06:58.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个能转向，挺好用的功能
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.74,0:06:59.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我觉得吧
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.11,0:07:04.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个只能显示静态图像了
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.68,0:07:11.02,Chinese,,0,0,0,,并不是完全的屏幕共享
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.28,0:07:24.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我觉得这个游戏我之前玩过
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.88,0:07:29.77,Chinese,,0,0,0,,有点意思啊，玩纸牌的时候
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.88,0:07:32.16,Comments,,0,0,0,,注：一般咱说的Windows附带纸牌都叫克朗代克
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.77,0:07:32.16,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这玩意更新快了些
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.80,0:07:38.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,没错，是快了点，但是
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.56,0:07:45.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,很明显这个不是实时更新的
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.36,0:07:49.45,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这确实挺好的，但我还是不太明白其背后的原理
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.61,0:07:55.63,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我发现，屏幕上的东西越多，屏幕刷新得越缓慢
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.29,0:08:00.75,Chinese,,0,0,0,,也许转接器先判断前后
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.56,0:08:05.58,Chinese,,0,0,0,,显示的不同，然后只更新那一块屏幕
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.80,0:08:09.24,Chinese,,0,0,0,,要真是这样的话，确实挺精巧的
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.24,0:08:13.23,Chinese,,0,0,0,,尽管它输出的不是视频流
Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.15,0:08:21.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,说真的我真不知道其背后的原理
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.79,0:08:24.47,Chinese,,0,0,0,,无论如何，该展示的我都展示了
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.47,0:08:28.73,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但确实很不错。虽然它刷新得确实很慢
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.84,0:08:32.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但瑕不掩瑜。它确实能很快地提供PDA实时的画面
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.86,0:08:39.20,Chinese,,0,0,0,,总比用PDA截完图再投射好多了吧
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.37,0:08:43.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我现在直接可以将转接器接到采集设备
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.00,0:08:46.24,Chinese,,0,0,0,,既然说到这了，我现在给大家展示一下效果
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.24,0:08:48.11,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在我把信号切到了转接器
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.82,0:08:53.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,没错，你可以像这样直接从PDA采集信号
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.69,0:08:58.27,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然而还是很慢，所以这个并不适合采集游戏实况
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.27,0:09:02.05,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过，能很方便地展示PDA显示还是挺好的
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.41,0:09:05.95,Chinese,,0,0,0,,诸如PPT之类的，甚至是图片秀，幻灯片
Dialogue: 0,0:09:06.45,0:09:10.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我觉得这个对商业用户来说十分合适
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.82,0:09:14.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,或者是那些喜欢显摆自己度假照片的小布尔乔亚:-P
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.83,0:09:17.29,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你要是有了相机附件的话，为何不再来个这个呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:09:18.24,0:09:21.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,最后，我给大家说一下遥控器
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.40,0:09:24.40,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我一开始是想看看这个是怎么用的
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.40,0:09:27.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我觉得这个跟翻页笔一样，能翻页
Dialogue: 0,0:09:27.72,0:09:34.20,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过，可惜的是，里面的电池给腐蚀了
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.70,0:09:41.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,虽然这样的腐蚀并不太常见，但这个确实是这样
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.78,0:09:48.42,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个是 CR2025 电池，我手里没有
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.78,0:09:48.42,Comments,,0,0,0,,注： CR2025是一类纽扣电池 电压3V 容量150mAh 重量2.5g
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.42,0:09:51.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以现在我测试不了
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.14,0:09:52.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我PDA上面也没装PowerPoint
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.80,0:09:54.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以我不知道播放PPT时的效果
Dialogue: 0,0:09:55.72,0:10:02.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,无论如何，我讲完了。感谢大家收看
