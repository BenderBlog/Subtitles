Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.07,0:00:07.29,English,,0,0,0,,Greetings, and welcome to LGR Oddware,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.29,0:00:12.84,English,,0,0,0,,where we're taking a look at hardware and software that is odd, forgotten, and obsolete,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.84,0:00:17.28,English,,0,0,0,,like this thing here, the Yamaha DiscT@2ing system,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.28,0:00:21.67,English,,0,0,0,,or rather the drive that allowed it to happen in the early 2000s.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.67,0:00:23.88,English,,0,0,0,,And yeah it's kind of just a CD-RW,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.88,0:00:28.55,English,,0,0,0,,but its whole gimmick was the fact that you could burn,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.55,0:00:33.55,English,,0,0,0,,or ink, "tattoos" directly onto your CD-R media,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.78,0:00:37.70,English,,0,0,0,,not the label side, the data side.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.70,0:00:38.65,English,,0,0,0,,Let's check it out.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.82,0:00:45.01,English,,0,0,0,,All right, so let's take a closer look at the Yamaha CRW-F1,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.01,0:00:49.66,English,,0,0,0,,or more precisely the external SCSI version known as the F1SX.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.66,0:00:53.47,English,,0,0,0,,Yamaha made multiple models, external and internal,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.47,0:00:55.01,English,,0,0,0,,many of which cost less than this one,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.01,0:01:00.01,English,,0,0,0,,but they all had the DiscT@2 laser labeling system built in.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.58,0:01:03.55,English,,0,0,0,,"Draw images on your discs." Mmm~
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.55,0:01:08.55,English,,0,0,0,,And this model cost a whopping $279.99.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.73,0:01:10.02,English,,0,0,0,,Internal versions cost less,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.02,0:01:14.18,English,,0,0,0,,but on average they were all more expensive than the other CD-RW options
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.18,0:01:18.07,English,,0,0,0,,when it released on July 15th, 2002.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.07,0:01:20.97,English,,0,0,0,,As if I really needed to say 2002, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.97,0:01:26.75,English,,0,0,0,,I mean, just take one look at that '@' sign in the name there and, yeah, 2002 indeed.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.75,0:01:29.81,English,,0,0,0,,Now overall, this really is just a CD-RW.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.81,0:01:32.93,English,,0,0,0,,I mean, it had a lotta great features for its time,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.93,0:01:35.82,English,,0,0,0,,but of course the standout was the 'T@2ing' ability,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.82,0:01:42.17,English,,0,0,0,,which Yamaha hailed as the first CD-RW drive that could be used for on-disc labeling.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.17,0:01:45.99,English,,0,0,0,,And it predates LightScribe by about two years.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.99,0:01:48.07,English,,0,0,0,,There are some important distinctions between them, though,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.07,0:01:52.04,English,,0,0,0,,because with LightScribe you had to have LightScribe media
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.04,0:01:56.50,English,,0,0,0,,and it printed on the label side, as you'd expect.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.50,0:02:01.64,English,,0,0,0,,But with DiscT@2ing, it's on the data side of the disc where it puts the label,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.64,0:02:06.97,English,,0,0,0,,which, yes, that means it limits your data storage capability on your CD-R.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.97,0:02:08.98,English,,0,0,0,,But Yamaha claimed that most users
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.98,0:02:12.36,English,,0,0,0,,only recorded about 350 megabytes onto CD-R anyway,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.36,0:02:14.28,English,,0,0,0,,so it's fine, don't worry about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.28,0:02:17.49,English,,0,0,0,,They were happy to brag about all of its cool applications
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.49,0:02:21.19,English,,0,0,0,,in its "Burnin' Love" press release, saying that you could write:
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.19,0:02:24.40,English,,0,0,0,,"Graphic images which are practically tattooed on,"
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.40,0:02:27.82,English,,0,0,0,,and, "This enables the user to write a practical memo
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.82,0:02:34.06,English,,0,0,0,,such as a date, index, logo or picture on the unused area of the disc."
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.06,0:02:38.31,English,,0,0,0,,And yeah, the other big distinction is that you can use any disc you want.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.31,0:02:42.24,English,,0,0,0,,As long as it's a CD-R, DiscT@2ing works.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.24,0:02:48.66,English,,0,0,0,,Though Yamaha did sell their own DiscT@2 media as well with blue AZO dye.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.66,0:02:52.48,English,,0,0,0,,Eh, so that was a thing, but yeah, you can use whatever CD-Rs you want.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.48,0:02:56.06,English,,0,0,0,,Now, the way this works, according to the old coverage that I found of this,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.06,0:03:02.25,English,,0,0,0,,is that you make a disc design and then that is then turned by the software into a bitmap
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.25,0:03:05.94,English,,0,0,0,,and converted from Cartesian to polar coordinates
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.94,0:03:10.39,English,,0,0,0,,before being written to the CRW-F1's 8-megabyte cache.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.39,0:03:12.23,English,,0,0,0,,And then the data is transferred sequentially
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.23,0:03:16.51,English,,0,0,0,,from the cache to the YDC132-V controller chip,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.51,0:03:19.57,English,,0,0,0,,something Yamaha was very proud of, it was in all the marketing,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.57,0:03:24.67,English,,0,0,0,,and then it converts the greyscale information from the image into a pixel pattern
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.67,0:03:29.19,English,,0,0,0,,with a minimum pixel size, or pit size, of .1 millimeter.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.19,0:03:31.60,English,,0,0,0,,And of course this also meant that the disc's
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.60,0:03:35.30,English,,0,0,0,,table of contents had to be written before the label,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.30,0:03:37.17,English,,0,0,0,,otherwise there'd be problems with drives
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.17,0:03:40.62,English,,0,0,0,,trying to read the label with its tiny little pits as data
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.62,0:03:43.35,English,,0,0,0,,and then screwing things up, and you don't want that.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.35,0:03:46.33,English,,0,0,0,,And as soon as I heard about thing, the obvious question is,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.33,0:03:48.91,English,,0,0,0,,"What in the world are the results like?"
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.91,0:03:52.83,English,,0,0,0,,because Yamaha always showed these higher-contrast images
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.83,0:03:56.18,English,,0,0,0,,on blue CD-Rs and press releases and ads and whatnot
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.18,0:03:59.50,English,,0,0,0,,and it all seemed very controlled, made me a little skeptical.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.50,0:04:02.48,English,,0,0,0,,And the overall consensus from reviewers at the time
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.48,0:04:07.34,English,,0,0,0,,seems to be that DiscT@2ing was fun but not very useful.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.34,0:04:09.93,English,,0,0,0,,It was praised largely for its other features.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.93,0:04:11.01,English,,0,0,0,,You know, the drive itself.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.01,0:04:13.55,English,,0,0,0,,It had very fast CD-RW writing,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.55,0:04:14.96,English,,0,0,0,,a large eight-megabyte buffer,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.96,0:04:17.61,English,,0,0,0,,and a whole buncha really cool audio recording stuff,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.61,0:04:20.21,English,,0,0,0,,but it was deemed to not really be worth
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.21,0:04:23.88,English,,0,0,0,,the relatively high asking price compared to its competitors.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.88,0:04:26.30,English,,0,0,0,,So most reviewers just said, "Wait for a sale."
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.30,0:04:28.38,English,,0,0,0,,And, well, it didn't last very long.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.38,0:04:31.23,English,,0,0,0,,Yamaha actually stopped making the drives in 2003,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.23,0:04:34.17,English,,0,0,0,,so this barely lasted a year on the market
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.17,0:04:38.48,English,,0,0,0,,before having the plug pulled and DiscT@2ing was all but forgotten about,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.48,0:04:41.76,English,,0,0,0,,with a notable exception, because the tech kind of evolved
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.76,0:04:45.63,English,,0,0,0,,and it eventually resulted in Labelflash in 2005,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.63,0:04:48.83,English,,0,0,0,,which was a collaboration between Yamaha and Fujifilm.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.83,0:04:50.19,English,,0,0,0,,And while that was very similar
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.19,0:04:54.55,English,,0,0,0,,in that you could print labels on the data side of your DVD,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.55,0:04:56.83,English,,0,0,0,,it was only DVDs and not CDs
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.83,0:05:02.17,English,,0,0,0,,and it required a proprietary DVD-R media supporting Labelflash.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.17,0:05:05.80,English,,0,0,0,,And even more similar than that was Lite-On's LabelTag,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.80,0:05:09.83,English,,0,0,0,,although it's not really related as far as I can tell in terms of the tech.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.83,0:05:13.85,English,,0,0,0,,That arrived in 2010 and it didn't need proprietary discs,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.85,0:05:21.13,English,,0,0,0,,much like DiscT@2, but again, it only worked on DVD recordable media, not CD-Rs.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.13,0:05:26.50,English,,0,0,0,,Also of note is that despite the fact that DiscT@2 was dropped by Yamaha in 2003,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.50,0:05:33.72,English,,0,0,0,,NEC and Pioneer also built drives with DiscT@2 support until 2010, technically.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.72,0:05:38.84,English,,0,0,0,,More so it was included by default because of the aforementioned Labelflash
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.84,0:05:45.03,English,,0,0,0,,and Labelflash DVD burners retained DiscT@2 compatibility, just kind of as a given.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.03,0:05:47.48,English,,0,0,0,,Now, like I said, there were multiple versions of this.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.48,0:05:49.86,English,,0,0,0,,This just happens to be the external SCSI version,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.86,0:05:54.55,English,,0,0,0,,but there was also an external USB 2.0 model, and a Firewire one
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.55,0:06:01.14,English,,0,0,0,,and internal drives fitting in 5.25" drive bays over IDE in either white or black.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.14,0:06:04.42,English,,0,0,0,,And, you know, any of these drives would've been pretty awesome to have at the time,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.42,0:06:06.57,English,,0,0,0,,just even without the DiscT@2ing.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.57,0:06:07.93,English,,0,0,0,,It's other capabilities?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.93,0:06:09.84,English,,0,0,0,,That's not why it's on "Oddware" here,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.84,0:06:14.15,English,,0,0,0,,because, uh, the other stuff is pretty great, not odd at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.15,0:06:16.95,English,,0,0,0,,It's got a lotta great specs. Which I'm not interested in!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.95,0:06:20.73,English,,0,0,0,,We're just gonna take a look at the DiscT@2ing features here,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.73,0:06:22.62,English,,0,0,0,,so let's get it unboxed and set up.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.38,0:06:30.10,English,,0,0,0,,So you can see from the package contents what was supposed to be in here originally,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.10,0:06:33.78,English,,0,0,0,,but unfortunately it's not quite complete in this case.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.78,0:06:35.94,English,,0,0,0,,But that's fine, it's still got what we need,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.94,0:06:40.94,English,,0,0,0,,including the AC adapter, 12-volt, 3-amp, 36 watts.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.04,0:06:44.24,English,,0,0,0,,And the software, which, really, this is all we need
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.24,0:06:47.28,English,,0,0,0,,since we're using the Windows version here.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.28,0:06:51.87,English,,0,0,0,,It also came with some Mac software with a different program for burning stuff, Toast 5.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.87,0:06:55.54,English,,0,0,0,,And a quick start guide, also this is also for the Macintosh.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.54,0:06:59.26,English,,0,0,0,,There's no Windows one. It was lost by the previous owner.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.26,0:07:02.99,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah, and then you got the drive itself.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.99,0:07:04.84,English,,0,0,0,,And there we go.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.84,0:07:07.70,English,,0,0,0,,Pretty standard-lookin' external CD-RW drive
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.70,0:07:10.78,English,,0,0,0,,with that nice Yamaha logo debossed into the top.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.78,0:07:13.74,English,,0,0,0,,Pretty groovy sides goin' on here.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.74,0:07:16.58,English,,0,0,0,,And around back, SCSI connections,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.58,0:07:19.07,English,,0,0,0,,including some termination points,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.07,0:07:21.72,English,,0,0,0,,RCA line out for CD audio,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.72,0:07:23.68,English,,0,0,0,,power switch and port, that kinda thing.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.68,0:07:28.22,English,,0,0,0,,But yeah, it's high time to get this plugged into a Windows XP PC
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.22,0:07:32.83,English,,0,0,0,,and try our hand at inking up some CD-Rs with DiscT@2 :-)
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.95,0:07:44.80,English,,0,0,0,,All right, so I've got the Yamaha drive plugged in to the Windows XP PC going here,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.80,0:07:47.04,English,,0,0,0,,and that goes straight into SCSI.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.04,0:07:49.24,English,,0,0,0,,And in terms of setup it's incredibly simple.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.24,0:07:52.17,English,,0,0,0,,I've already done it. It pretty much just does it itself.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.17,0:07:56.93,English,,0,0,0,,The Adaptec SCSI controller card that's in this system just goes ahead and finds it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.93,0:08:01.46,English,,0,0,0,,And it's that right there, it sees it as a CRW-F1S.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.46,0:08:07.23,English,,0,0,0,,And at this point it just looks like any other CD-RW that you have on Windows XP.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.23,0:08:09.21,English,,0,0,0,,So it is ready to go.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.21,0:08:13.80,English,,0,0,0,,And in terms of the software, that's also a little simpler than I thought it might be.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.78,0:08:20.06,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah, that thing whirring to life has got some noise.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.06,0:08:21.52,English,,0,0,0,,Anyway, yeah, this is it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.52,0:08:28.92,English,,0,0,0,,It's just a Nero 5 installation with regular versions of Nero and NCD packet writing,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.92,0:08:32.90,English,,0,0,0,,so you just install it like you normally would Nero Burning ROM.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.90,0:08:35.14,English,,0,0,0,,No special drivers or Yamaha software
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.14,0:08:39.54,English,,0,0,0,,or anything outside of the actual burning software itself.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.54,0:08:44.27,English,,0,0,0,,So we'll go ahead and grab ourselves a CD-R.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.27,0:08:47.27,English,,0,0,0,,I got a fresh pack here.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.27,0:08:49.61,English,,0,0,0,,'Bout ready to boot up some LimeWire and get us some music.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.61,0:08:50.44,English,,0,0,0,,No, don't do that.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.44,0:08:51.93,English,,0,0,0,,That's a terrible idea these days.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.83,0:08:55.16,English,,0,0,0,,Actually, it was a terrible idea back in the day, too.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.04,0:09:28.73,English,,0,0,0,,so really familiar and awesome to use.

Dialogue: 0,0:11:23.31,0:11:26.72,English,,0,0,0,,So you can hit the preview and there's kinda what you might get.

Dialogue: 0,0:11:48.16,0:11:50.80,English,,0,0,0,,and then you get some weird buffer or disc writing problem.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:50.80,0:11:56.10,English,,0,0,0,,All right, and it burned our ridiculously tiny three-megabyte CD-ROM image here.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:56.10,0:11:58.49,English,,0,0,0,,And now it switches over to this process:

Dialogue: 0,0:12:11.61,0:12:13.56,English,,0,0,0,,So let's see what we got.

Dialogue: 0,0:12:32.16,0:12:34.68,English,,0,0,0,,No? Okay, there's a tiny bit...
Dialogue: 0,0:12:34.68,0:12:36.15,English,,0,0,0,,Well, let me get another angle.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:36.15,0:12:38.03,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah, there's a little, tiny bit
Dialogue: 0,0:12:38.03,0:12:43.71,English,,0,0,0,,of that rocky formation coming through of the photo that we put in the background.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:43.71,0:12:48.35,English,,0,0,0,,And you can see Comic Sans, just the text put on there,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:48.35,0:12:51.08,English,,0,0,0,,but if you didn't know there was supposed to be a label on there,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:51.08,0:12:52.17,English,,0,0,0,,you couldn't really tell.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:52.17,0:12:55.78,English,,0,0,0,,I mean, from where I'm sitting, I can see the T@2 in there,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:55.78,0:12:59.57,English,,0,0,0,,just like a third of the disc at a time.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:59.57,0:13:04.34,English,,0,0,0,,But really, the thing that's even more obvious that I can see when putting it up to the light
Dialogue: 0,0:13:04.34,0:13:10.87,English,,0,0,0,,is the label from other side shining through the CD-R.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:11.07,0:13:14.76,English,,0,0,0,,That's like 20 times more visible than the tattoo is.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:14.76,0:13:18.85,English,,0,0,0,,So I was looking through some old reviews about the DiscT@2ing system
Dialogue: 0,0:13:18.85,0:13:20.96,English,,0,0,0,,and that was one of the primary complaints.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:20.96,0:13:25.41,English,,0,0,0,,It was like you just can't see whatever you tattooed on the back of your CD,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:25.41,0:13:31.41,English,,0,0,0,,on your typical CD-R, with a lighter greenish type of dye that's used.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:31.41,0:13:36.43,English,,0,0,0,,So what Yamaha recommended was to use CD-Rs that are a different color.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:36.43,0:13:38.59,English,,0,0,0,,So one that I had on hand,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:38.59,0:13:43.36,English,,0,0,0,,this right here is just a CD-RW from Maxell.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:43.36,0:13:45.56,English,,0,0,0,,And you can see it's a lot darker,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:45.56,0:13:50.10,English,,0,0,0,,which should result in a darker, more bold T@2.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:50.10,0:13:52.66,English,,0,0,0,,However, there's a problem.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:52.66,0:13:56.77,English,,0,0,0,,It throws up a warning that this CD is not a CD-R.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:56.77,0:14:00.47,English,,0,0,0,,"DiscT@2s can only be printed on a CD-R.

Dialogue: 0,0:14:02.75,0:14:03.70,English,,0,0,0,,so please change it."
Dialogue: 0,0:14:03.70,0:14:08.60,English,,0,0,0,,I'm not sure why that's a restriction, exactly, but it just sees it as not a CD-R,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:08.60,0:14:10.95,English,,0,0,0,,so I can't use those.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:10.95,0:14:15.38,English,,0,0,0,,So I went and ordered some of the ones that Yamaha actually seems to have recommended,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:15.38,0:14:22.82,English,,0,0,0,,these premium CD-Rs like the DataLifePlus here from Verbatim with AZO Blue technology.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:22.82,0:14:25.99,English,,0,0,0,,Better quality CD-Rs, something I never got back in the day
Dialogue: 0,0:14:25.99,0:14:27.91,English,,0,0,0,,'cause they were just too expensive.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:27.91,0:14:32.79,English,,0,0,0,,But they do have a notably darker tone to them.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:32.79,0:14:35.80,English,,0,0,0,,I mean, look at that. Yeah, look at me.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:35.80,0:14:39.70,English,,0,0,0,,So this should be pretty much the ideal DiscT@2 medium.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:42.22,0:14:46.44,English,,0,0,0,,So we're gonna try that and adjust the image just a little bit here
Dialogue: 0,0:14:46.44,0:14:49.56,English,,0,0,0,,to see if we can get a more bold, higher-contrasty look.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:49.56,0:14:51.28,English,,0,0,0,,Adjust the background a little bit here
Dialogue: 0,0:14:51.28,0:14:55.12,English,,0,0,0,,to make it, yeah, not quite the same all the way around.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:55.12,0:15:00.22,English,,0,0,0,,And I'm gonna go in the opposite direction with the color of the text.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:01.72,0:15:04.03,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah, black with white around the edges.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:04.03,0:15:05.57,English,,0,0,0,,We'll see if that works.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:05.57,0:15:08.21,English,,0,0,0,,All right, it sees that as a CD-R,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:08.21,0:15:10.87,English,,0,0,0,,which it is, so good.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:10.87,0:15:13.16,English,,0,0,0,,All right, and we'll let it do its thing here.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:13.16,0:15:15.93,English,,0,0,0,,I'll be back in about five or six minutes.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:15.93,0:15:17.96,English,,0,0,0,,Okay, let's see what we got.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:20.32,0:15:22.01,English,,0,0,0,,Oh, yeah. This is better.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:22.01,0:15:26.21,English,,0,0,0,,Now that is a DiscT@2.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:26.21,0:15:31.15,English,,0,0,0,,A little more in line with what I was imagining slash hoping for.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:31.15,0:15:33.85,English,,0,0,0,,Still not the most visible thing in the world,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:33.85,0:15:37.26,English,,0,0,0,,but at least it's immediately obvious at a quick glance
Dialogue: 0,0:15:37.26,0:15:42.26,English,,0,0,0,,that it is supposed to be a label of sorts.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:42.63,0:15:44.53,English,,0,0,0,,Making the text black certainly helped,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:44.53,0:15:49.72,English,,0,0,0,,but, I mean, you can see even the white stroke around the text a lot more easily,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:49.72,0:15:54.15,English,,0,0,0,,and of course, you can actually make out some of the photo that's on there.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:54.15,0:15:59.00,English,,0,0,0,,I kinda see there, behind the O and the M, just little bits of rock formations.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:59.00,0:16:04.56,English,,0,0,0,,Anyway, it's there. Again, you can only see it from certain angles,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:04.56,0:16:07.24,English,,0,0,0,,and certain percentages of the disc at once,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:07.24,0:16:10.01,English,,0,0,0,,but I can see probably half of the disc at once
Dialogue: 0,0:16:10.01,0:16:12.70,English,,0,0,0,,as opposed to maybe just a third with the other one.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:12.70,0:16:13.59,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah. I mean, look at that.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:13.59,0:16:16.89,English,,0,0,0,,Just still a pretty lackluster result.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:16.89,0:16:19.82,English,,0,0,0,,And being that we had to use one of the higher-quality,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:19.82,0:16:22.87,English,,0,0,0,,consumer-grade CD recordable media.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:22.87,0:16:26.81,English,,0,0,0,,In order to pull off even this meh kinda result,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:26.81,0:16:31.05,English,,0,0,0,,then you can see why this didn't exactly set the world on fire
Dialogue: 0,0:16:31.05,0:16:35.47,English,,0,0,0,,in terms of disc labeling options inside of CD recordable drives.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:35.47,0:16:37.77,English,,0,0,0,,The thing is, though, this is all the unused space.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:37.77,0:16:40.84,English,,0,0,0,,It's just that little ring, a tiny little bit in the middle there,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:40.84,0:16:44.57,English,,0,0,0,,that it's actually using to store data, only a few megs.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:44.57,0:16:50.14,English,,0,0,0,,So let's see what happens if we have basically the entire CD-R full of data.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:50.14,0:16:52.67,English,,0,0,0,,And in order to test this, I figured I'd take the opportunity
Dialogue: 0,0:16:52.67,0:16:58.89,English,,0,0,0,,to try one of these color CD-Rs that were sold by various companies back in the day.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:58.89,0:17:02.00,English,,0,0,0,,I think these are from Memorex. Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:02.00,0:17:03.92,English,,0,0,0,,I don't know if the dye is any different
Dialogue: 0,0:17:03.92,0:17:05.58,English,,0,0,0,,or even what kinda dye is used inside,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:05.58,0:17:07.87,English,,0,0,0,,but I know that the polycarbonate, at least,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:07.87,0:17:12.87,English,,0,0,0,,is tinted in such a way that it's got a color to it.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:12.95,0:17:15.86,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah. Memorex Cool Colors.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:15.86,0:17:22.12,English,,0,0,0,,So you got the regular label on that side and then the data side here has a hue added to it.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:22.12,0:17:25.30,English,,0,0,0,,And to fill up a good chunk of the disc, we're gonna go meta here
Dialogue: 0,0:17:25.30,0:17:30.62,English,,0,0,0,,and burn the "Oddware" episode that we're recording right now, or at least a chunk of it.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:30.62,0:17:36.28,English,,0,0,0,,"And this is where you take care of doin' T@2s. And it works..."
Dialogue: 0,0:17:36.28,0:17:38.10,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah, that's just weird. "Oddwareception."
Dialogue: 0,0:17:38.10,0:17:40.32,English,,0,0,0,,So this just goes into our ISO we just made here.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:40.32,0:17:42.91,English,,0,0,0,,Takes up about 500 megs of space,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:42.91,0:17:47.91,English,,0,0,0,,leaving us this much to actually write our T@2 to the disc.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:48.28,0:17:50.72,English,,0,0,0,,And now, at this point,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:50.72,0:17:57.04,English,,0,0,0,,I'm assuming it will cut down what we can actually do in the label creator...
Dialogue: 0,0:17:57.04,0:17:59.20,English,,0,0,0,,Okay, I guess not.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:59.20,0:18:00.41,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah, I got the CD-R in there.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:00.41,0:18:02.82,English,,0,0,0,,I knows how big it is and how much space we're gonna be using,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:02.82,0:18:06.08,English,,0,0,0,,so I would assume that it would've automatically adjusted this.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:06.08,0:18:08.21,English,,0,0,0,,I mean, we can do it manually.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:09.35,0:18:11.70,English,,0,0,0,,You can see that shrinks down the radius.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:11.70,0:18:13.95,English,,0,0,0,,But, I don't know, let's just put something in there.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.01,0:00:49.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,有一个更加稀有的外置SCSI接口版，型号F1SX
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.66,0:00:53.47,Chinese,,0,0,0,,雅马哈生产了很多种型号，有内置的，有外置的
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.47,0:00:55.01,Chinese,,0,0,0,,大多数都要比这个便宜
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.01,0:01:00.01,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是他们都内置了DiscT@2功能
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.58,0:01:03.55,Chinese,,0,0,0,,“在光盘上刻上图像”，好有趣呢
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.55,0:01:08.55,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个型号发布于2002-7-15
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.73,0:01:10.02,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当年要卖279.99美元
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.02,0:01:14.18,Chinese,,0,0,0,,内置版的要便宜些
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.18,0:01:18.07,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过他们都要比当时同类的CD刻录机要贵上不少
Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.07,0:01:20.97,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好像我说发布年份有点啰嗦了
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.97,0:01:26.75,Chinese,,0,0,0,,是吧，你看看名称上的“@”标志，妥妥的时代印记:-P

Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.93,0:01:35.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过最具代表性的就是"T@2ing"科技了
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.82,0:01:42.17,Chinese,,0,0,0,,雅马哈声称这是第一个可以在CD数据面上刻上标签的刻录机
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.17,0:01:45.99,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个技术也比LightScribe技术早了两年
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.99,0:01:48.07,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，这两个技术之间还是有所区别的
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.07,0:01:52.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你要使用LightScribe技术的话，你需要用专门
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.04,0:01:56.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,为LightScribe设计的刻录盘，当然，这是印在标签面的
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.50,0:02:01.64,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过使用DiscT@2ing技术的话，你就可以在数据面上刻标签了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.64,0:02:06.97,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过，这样会减少你能在CD上刻录上的容量
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.97,0:02:12.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过雅马哈说，大多数用户只会在光盘上刻录350MB的数据
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.36,0:02:14.28,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以限制点就限制点吧:-P
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.28,0:02:17.49,Chinese,,0,0,0,,雅马哈还在宣传物上大肆宣传
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.49,0:02:21.19,Chinese,,0,0,0,,该技术的广泛用途，声称可以刻上

Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.06,0:02:38.31,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而且，还有一个区别，你可以在任意一张刻录CD上刻上图案
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.31,0:02:42.24,Chinese,,0,0,0,,只要是刻录CD，DiscT@2ing就能用
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.24,0:02:48.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过雅马哈还是专门出品了为该特性设计的刻录盘
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.66,0:02:52.48,Chinese,,0,0,0,,用的是蓝色AZO染料，当然，你也可以用自己的CD-R
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.66,0:02:52.48,Comments,,0,0,0,,注：刻录光盘的工作原理就是光盘上的染料受到激光影响而变化，进而产生“坑”
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.48,0:02:56.06,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在我查阅了很多老资料后，我现在要介绍使用方法了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.06,0:03:02.25,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你自己设计图案，然后程序将你的设计图案转换为位图
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.25,0:03:10.39,Chinese,,0,0,0,,并在将其写入刻录机的8MB缓存前，将直角坐标转变为极坐标
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.39,0:03:16.51,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后数据就从缓存按顺序传输到YDC132-V控制芯片
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.51,0:03:19.57,Chinese,,0,0,0,,看上去雅马哈对这个芯片引以为傲，营销词上到处都有提到
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.57,0:03:24.67,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后它将图案上的灰度值转换成像素元素
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.67,0:03:29.19,Chinese,,0,0,0,,内含一最小的像素大小，亦称坑大小，也就是0.1mm
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.19,0:03:35.30,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，这也意味着，光盘的目录必须在刻录图案前写入光盘
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.19,0:03:35.30,Comments,,0,0,0,,注：光盘的“目录”就是指光盘上数据区的位置，或是音轨的位置\N而数据区前有lead-in，后有lead-out，相当于基因的启动子和终止子
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.30,0:03:40.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,要不然，光驱就会尝试读取图案里的“坑”，误读取出数据
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.30,0:03:40.62,Comments,,0,0,0,,注：把光盘放大后，你会发现光盘上的数据就是通过有坑与没坑的状态存储的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.62,0:03:43.35,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后一切都变得混乱，你绝对不想看到吧:-P
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.35,0:03:48.91,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我看完这些介绍后，就想：”到底最终会有怎样的效果呢？“
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.91,0:03:52.83,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因为无论是在介绍资料，还是在广告啥的，雅马哈一直在展示

Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.34,0:04:11.01,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过这个光驱的其他特性是受到了广泛好评
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.01,0:04:13.55,Chinese,,0,0,0,,它的刻录速度很快
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.55,0:04:14.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,内置8MB大缓存

Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.61,0:04:23.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过相比同类产品，卖这么高的价格确实有点不值
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.88,0:04:26.30,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以评论界一致认为：“等促销再买吧。”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.30,0:04:28.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然而，它在市场上没有存在很长时间
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.38,0:04:31.23,Chinese,,0,0,0,,雅马哈早在2003年就停止生产这个产品了
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.23,0:04:34.17,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以在官方砍掉这个产品前，他只在市场存在了
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.17,0:04:38.48,Chinese,,0,0,0,,大概一年吧，而且DiscT@2技术要不是这件事外
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.48,0:04:41.76,Chinese,,0,0,0,,基本也要被大家遗忘了，由于技术的进步

Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.17,0:05:05.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,还有一个相似的技术，就是Lite-On的LabelTag技术
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.80,0:05:09.83,Chinese,,0,0,0,,尽管在技术层面，这和我今天要讲的东西没啥关系
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.83,0:05:13.85,Chinese,,0,0,0,,它发布于2010年，无需专门买盘即可刻录，和DiscT@2相似
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.85,0:05:21.13,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是，这个技术仍然仅支持DVD刻录盘，不支持CD刻录盘
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.13,0:05:26.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,还有一件事，尽管DiscT@2技术在2003年被雅马哈抛弃
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.50,0:05:33.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,NEC和先锋公司直到2010年仍在生产支持该技术的光驱
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.72,0:05:38.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而预置该功能的原因是前面提到的Lableflash
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.84,0:05:45.03,Chinese,,0,0,0,,支持Laserflash的刻录机仍保留DiscT@2的兼容性，就这样
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.03,0:05:47.48,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我之前说过，这类光驱有很多种不同的版本
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.48,0:05:49.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而这个正好是外置SCSI接口版的

Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.94,0:06:40.94,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这是一个电源适配器，12V*3A=36W
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.04,0:06:44.24,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后这个软件盘也很重要
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.24,0:06:47.28,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们这里选用Windows版的
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.28,0:06:51.87,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这里也有一张Mac版的刻录软件光盘，里面是另一个刻录软件
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.87,0:06:55.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,还有一个快速入门指南，这是Mac版的
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.54,0:06:59.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,可惜没有Windows版的，估计之前使用它的人给弄丢了吧
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.26,0:07:02.99,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后呢，就是刻录机本体了
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.99,0:07:04.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,就是这个了
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.84,0:07:07.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个光驱看上去中规中矩
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.70,0:07:10.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,顶部有一个雅马哈标志的浮雕
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.78,0:07:13.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,侧面在当时听流行的

Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.72,0:07:23.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,电源开关和接口啥的
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.68,0:07:28.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好的，现在我们来将这个光驱接到Windows XP电脑上
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.22,0:07:32.83,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后在光盘上刻些图案吧
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.95,0:07:44.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好的，我已经把光驱接到电脑上了
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.80,0:07:47.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,走的是SCSI接口
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.04,0:07:49.24,Chinese,,0,0,0,,设置光驱还挺简单的呢
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.24,0:07:52.17,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我已经搞完了，基本上它自己就能处理一切
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.17,0:07:56.93,Chinese,,0,0,0,,电脑里的SCSI控制卡直接就认出光驱了
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.93,0:08:01.46,Chinese,,0,0,0,,就是这个，看上去是CRW-F1S
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.46,0:08:07.23,Chinese,,0,0,0,,目前它看上去就是个很普通的CD刻录机
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.23,0:08:09.21,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在一切准备就绪
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.21,0:08:13.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而刻录软件方面呢，比我想的要简单
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.78,0:08:20.06,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好吧，这个光驱十分的吵
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.06,0:08:21.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,无论如何，这就是软件安装界面了，十分普通
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.52,0:08:28.92,Chinese,,0,0,0,,安装的是Nero 5，有刻录软件和NCD刻录软件
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.92,0:08:32.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你直接安装就行了，就跟你平常安装Nero刻录软件一样
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.90,0:08:35.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,除了这个软件，我们不需要再安装驱动或是
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.14,0:08:39.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,雅马哈定制软件啥的了
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.54,0:08:44.27,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在我们要拿出一张CD-R光盘了
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.27,0:08:47.27,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我这有一大摞全新的呢

Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.17,0:09:05.53,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在，咱打开安装的刻录软件
Dialogue: 0,0:09:05.53,0:09:09.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,也许你们之前注意到了，版本号和平常的有一丁点不同
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.98,0:09:14.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,普通版本号后面有“雅马哈”字样
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.70,0:09:21.73,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个软件相比原来的Nero 5有略微魔改扩充，我觉得挺好的
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.73,0:09:26.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我现在依然在使用新版的Nero来刻盘
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.04,0:09:28.73,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以对我而言，这玩意界面熟悉，用起来很顺手
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.73,0:09:29.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,看起来都没什么区别
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.88,0:09:33.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,除非你在刻录时有特殊需求，需要点进“杂项”菜单
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.80,0:09:38.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而这里有DiscT@2选项
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.68,0:09:44.43,Chinese,,0,0,0,,选上并点击“创建”后，你会看到图案编辑器
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.43,0:09:48.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这里你就可以设计刻在光盘上的图案了
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.98,0:09:54.83,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个见面很像我见过的其他光盘标签编辑器了
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.83,0:09:56.13,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我都不知道我在瞎画些什么
Dialogue: 0,0:09:56.13,0:09:58.33,Chinese,,0,0,0,,要不我往上面写点字
Dialogue: 0,0:09:58.33,0:10:01.77,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这里有文本框工具，还有艺术字工具？
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.53,0:10:08.35,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好吧，我们可以改字号
Dialogue: 0,0:10:08.35,0:10:12.16,Chinese,,0,0,0,,也可以随便改字体
Dialogue: 0,0:10:12.16,0:10:15.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好吧，咱调皮一回，用个Comic Sans吧
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.38,0:10:16.99,Chinese,,0,0,0,,针对字体，还有很多不同的选项
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.99,0:10:20.02,Chinese,,0,0,0,,比如只读，也就是设定完后，就不能编辑了
Dialogue: 0,0:10:20.02,0:10:23.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,也可以弯曲，咱来看看啥效果
Dialogue: 0,0:10:23.90,0:10:27.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,哦，合着就是绕着光盘中心转啊
Dialogue: 0,0:10:27.78,0:10:30.64,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后可以这么做
Dialogue: 0,0:10:30.64,0:10:32.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，你也可以加些图片
Dialogue: 0,0:10:32.96,0:10:36.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,就放在这吧
Dialogue: 0,0:10:36.12,0:10:39.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好的，看看啊，CD上有张图片诶
Dialogue: 0,0:10:39.00,0:10:40.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我不知道最终效果会怎样
Dialogue: 0,0:10:40.36,0:10:42.37,Chinese,,0,0,0,,兴许有一千个哈姆雷特吧
Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.37,0:10:46.11,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在我们该在光盘上刻些字了
Dialogue: 0,0:10:46.11,0:10:47.21,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这是涂刷工具
Dialogue: 0,0:10:47.21,0:10:50.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,就是把文字给上色啊
Dialogue: 0,0:10:50.34,0:10:53.01,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你也可以填充些不同的样式
Dialogue: 0,0:10:53.01,0:10:58.75,Chinese,,0,0,0,,也可以改变颜色，我觉得没有任何意义
Dialogue: 0,0:10:58.75,0:11:01.71,Chinese,,0,0,0,,毕竟刻在盘上的图案肯定没有颜色
Dialogue: 0,0:11:01.71,0:11:03.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,刻录机可没法刻上颜色
Dialogue: 0,0:11:03.52,0:11:06.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,它只能在盘上的特定区域刻上形状
Dialogue: 0,0:11:06.50,0:11:08.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,真是理解不能
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.96,0:11:10.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好吧，咱把样式给去掉吧
Dialogue: 0,0:11:10.38,0:11:12.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,就用全白填充吧
Dialogue: 0,0:11:12.86,0:11:16.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好极了，全白的Comic Sans字体，好好看哦:-P
Dialogue: 0,0:11:16.50,0:11:21.73,Chinese,,0,0,0,,绕中心的字，以及不知为何被拉来当背景的图片
Dialogue: 0,0:11:21.73,0:11:23.31,Chinese,,0,0,0,,就这么刻了
Dialogue: 0,0:11:23.31,0:11:26.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你可以点下“预览”选项来看看最终成果
Dialogue: 0,0:11:26.72,0:11:28.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好吧，这挺好
Dialogue: 0,0:11:28.26,0:11:32.29,Chinese,,0,0,0,,到这里呢，就和刻录一张普通的CD没什么区别了
Dialogue: 0,0:11:32.29,0:11:33.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个嘛，也许我们不需要在盘上刻上太多东西
Dialogue: 0,0:11:33.88,0:11:37.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,就把我看到的图片给刻上吧
Dialogue: 0,0:11:38.53,0:11:41.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好的，开始刻录了
Dialogue: 0,0:11:41.68,0:11:44.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好吧，想起当年刻盘时，我又兴奋又紧张
Dialogue: 0,0:11:44.98,0:11:50.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当进度达到80%，遇到了某种缓存或写入错误时，真是崩溃啊
Dialogue: 0,0:11:50.80,0:11:56.10,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好的，超小的3MB的图像数据已经写入CD了
Dialogue: 0,0:11:56.10,0:11:58.49,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在正在切换至这个步骤
Dialogue: 0,0:11:58.49,0:12:01.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,“将位图刻进光盘”
Dialogue: 0,0:12:01.36,0:12:07.29,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在整张CD上刻上图片确实费时
Dialogue: 0,0:12:08.18,0:12:11.61,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好的，“位图文件刻录完毕”
Dialogue: 0,0:12:11.61,0:12:13.56,Chinese,,0,0,0,,看看成果吧
Dialogue: 0,0:12:23.98,0:12:26.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,效果真差:-(
Dialogue: 0,0:12:26.04,0:12:30.43,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你确实可以看到刻进去的图案......是吧？
Dialogue: 0,0:12:30.43,0:12:32.16,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我是看不到
Dialogue: 0,0:12:32.16,0:12:34.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,等会，这确实有一点......
Dialogue: 0,0:12:34.68,0:12:36.15,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好吧，换个角度来看
Dialogue: 0,0:12:36.15,0:12:43.71,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好吧，这里确实有一点背景图片的山峦啥的
Dialogue: 0,0:12:43.71,0:12:48.35,Chinese,,0,0,0,,还有那个我放上去的字
Dialogue: 0,0:12:48.35,0:12:52.17,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是呢，如果没人告诉你这里有图片的话，你八成看不出来
Dialogue: 0,0:12:52.17,0:12:55.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,从我目前的位置来看，这里确实有点图案
Dialogue: 0,0:12:55.78,0:12:59.57,Chinese,,0,0,0,,貌似在光盘的第三个数据区
Dialogue: 0,0:12:59.57,0:13:04.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过，如果我把光盘放在强光下的话
Dialogue: 0,0:13:04.34,0:13:10.87,Chinese,,0,0,0,,那光盘标签面透过来的痕迹就更明显了
Dialogue: 0,0:13:11.07,0:13:14.76,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我觉得比刻上去的图案还要清晰20倍
Dialogue: 0,0:13:14.76,0:13:18.85,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我在搜集对DiscT@2ing系统的看法时
Dialogue: 0,0:13:18.85,0:13:20.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我看到了很多对这种现象的抱怨
Dialogue: 0,0:13:20.96,0:13:25.41,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在普通的，浅色染料制作的刻录CD上
Dialogue: 0,0:13:25.41,0:13:31.41,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你不能看到CD数据面上所有刻上去的图案
Dialogue: 0,0:13:31.41,0:13:36.43,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在这种情况下，雅马哈推荐使用另一种颜色的光盘
Dialogue: 0,0:13:36.43,0:13:38.59,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个我倒是有
Dialogue: 0,0:13:38.59,0:13:43.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这是由Maxell生产的CD-RW盘
Dialogue: 0,0:13:43.36,0:13:45.56,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个的颜色更深
Dialogue: 0,0:13:45.56,0:13:50.10,Chinese,,0,0,0,,也许刻出来的图案颜色更深，更容易辨别
Dialogue: 0,0:13:50.10,0:13:52.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过，有一个问题
Dialogue: 0,0:13:52.66,0:13:56.77,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这玩意报错了，说这玩意不是CD-R
Dialogue: 0,0:13:56.77,0:14:00.47,Chinese,,0,0,0,,"DiscT@2s 只能刻在CD-R上

Dialogue: 0,0:14:03.70,0:14:08.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我也不知道为啥会有这个限制，不过，看上去
Dialogue: 0,0:14:08.60,0:14:10.95,Chinese,,0,0,0,,只要不是CD-R,就用不了
Dialogue: 0,0:14:10.95,0:14:15.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,于是我去买了些雅马哈推荐的顶级刻录盘
Dialogue: 0,0:14:15.38,0:14:22.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,诸如这个Verbatim生产的，使用了AZO蓝色染料
Dialogue: 0,0:14:22.82,0:14:27.91,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这种高品质的刻录盘，我那时买不起，因为太贵了
Dialogue: 0,0:14:27.91,0:14:32.79,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过数据面确实比通常的要深
Dialogue: 0,0:14:32.79,0:14:35.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,来看看吧，顺便欣赏我帅气的脸:^)
Dialogue: 0,0:14:35.80,0:14:39.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,也许这才是最适合使用 DiscT@2 的光盘吧
Dialogue: 0,0:14:42.22,0:14:46.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这里我用那张光盘，再稍微调整一下图片
Dialogue: 0,0:14:46.44,0:14:49.56,Chinese,,0,0,0,,看看能不能得到一张更深，对比度更高的图片
Dialogue: 0,0:14:49.56,0:14:55.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,调整一下图片，显得图片有点变化
Dialogue: 0,0:14:55.12,0:15:00.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这里我要将字上的颜色给改一下
Dialogue: 0,0:15:01.72,0:15:04.03,Chinese,,0,0,0,,没错，黑色填充，白色边框
Dialogue: 0,0:15:04.03,0:15:05.57,Chinese,,0,0,0,,一会看看效果如何
Dialogue: 0,0:15:05.57,0:15:10.87,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好的，认出这是张CD-R了，挺好
Dialogue: 0,0:15:10.87,0:15:13.16,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好的，就先让他刻着
Dialogue: 0,0:15:13.16,0:15:15.93,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我先花6分钟听首King Crimson去
Dialogue: 0,0:15:15.93,0:15:17.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好的，看看成果
Dialogue: 0,0:15:20.32,0:15:22.01,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好极了，效果好多了
Dialogue: 0,0:15:22.01,0:15:26.21,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这才是DiscT@2的真实效果啊
Dialogue: 0,0:15:26.21,0:15:31.15,Chinese,,0,0,0,,文字更明显了，符合我的预期
Dialogue: 0,0:15:31.15,0:15:33.85,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然而还不是特别明显
Dialogue: 0,0:15:33.85,0:15:42.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过至少让人能一眼看上去就知道上面有图案了
Dialogue: 0,0:15:42.63,0:15:44.53,Chinese,,0,0,0,,文字用黑色填充果然有用:-)
Dialogue: 0,0:15:44.53,0:15:49.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，文字周围的白色边框也能让文字更好认出了
Dialogue: 0,0:15:49.72,0:15:54.15,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而且，你也能看出这上面刻有图片
Dialogue: 0,0:15:54.15,0:15:59.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在O和M之间有个图像，像是岩石纹理
Dialogue: 0,0:15:59.00,0:16:07.24,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好吧，你得倾斜一定角度才能看到盘上的部分纹理
Dialogue: 0,0:16:07.24,0:16:12.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过我能一次性看到图片的一半到三分之二
Dialogue: 0,0:16:12.70,0:16:16.89,Chinese,,0,0,0,,来看看，这根本没法对比啊
Dialogue: 0,0:16:16.89,0:16:26.81,Chinese,,0,0,0,,要达到这种效果，你必须要用高质量的消费级CD刻录盘
Dialogue: 0,0:16:26.81,0:16:35.47,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你也看到，何在数据面刻上图案的主意在当年没有那么流行
Dialogue: 0,0:16:35.47,0:16:37.77,Chinese,,0,0,0,,还有一件事，刻上图案的部分都是没使用过的
Dialogue: 0,0:16:37.77,0:16:44.57,Chinese,,0,0,0,,数据区就是中间的一个小环，也就几MB大小:-P
Dialogue: 0,0:16:44.57,0:16:50.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在来看看如果我在CD-R上充分刻上数据会有什么结果
Dialogue: 0,0:16:50.14,0:16:58.89,Chinese,,0,0,0,,为了测试，我要使用这些不同厂家生产的彩色CD刻录盘
Dialogue: 0,0:16:58.89,0:17:02.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个应该是Memorex的吧
Dialogue: 0,0:17:02.00,0:17:05.58,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我不知道光盘上用的是啥染料，染料上有啥区别
Dialogue: 0,0:17:05.58,0:17:12.87,Chinese,,0,0,0,,至少我知道聚碳酸酯能让光盘上有色彩
Dialogue: 0,0:17:12.95,0:17:15.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这就是 Memorex Cool Colors 了
Dialogue: 0,0:17:15.86,0:17:22.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,标签面比较普通，但是数据面则是上过色的
Dialogue: 0,0:17:22.12,0:17:25.30,Chinese,,0,0,0,,为了在光盘上刻上大量数据，我给光盘取了个名字
Dialogue: 0,0:17:25.30,0:17:30.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,并将本期视频刻在光盘上，至少是一段片段

Dialogue: 0,0:17:38.10,0:17:40.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在我要打开我刚制作的ISO文件了
Dialogue: 0,0:17:40.32,0:17:42.91,Chinese,,0,0,0,,占用大约500MB空间
Dialogue: 0,0:17:42.91,0:17:47.91,Chinese,,0,0,0,,大致剩下这些空间来刻录我们的图案
Dialogue: 0,0:17:48.28,0:17:57.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在我有点怀疑，会不会在编辑器里限制空间
Dialogue: 0,0:17:57.04,0:17:59.20,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然而并没有
Dialogue: 0,0:17:59.20,0:18:00.41,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好的，我把光盘放入了
Dialogue: 0,0:18:00.41,0:18:02.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我知道文件很大，要占用多大地方刻录
Dialogue: 0,0:18:02.82,0:18:06.08,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我原先以为他会自动调整位置呢
Dialogue: 0,0:18:06.08,0:18:08.21,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，我们也能自己调整大小
Dialogue: 0,0:18:09.35,0:18:11.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我现在正在缩小半径呢
Dialogue: 0,0:18:11.70,0:18:13.95,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但也不知道对不对，先放些东西吧
Dialogue: 0,0:18:13.95,0:18:15.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,兴许回来能自动调整吧
Dialogue: 0,0:18:18.86,0:18:21.73,Chinese,,0,0,0,,说真的，我不知道这到底要占多大地儿，不过希望光盘能用
Dialogue: 0,0:18:21.73,0:18:25.51,Chinese,,0,0,0,,那么，咱们来试试，看最终如何吧
Dialogue: 0,0:18:25.51,0:18:26.89,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好的，这解开了我的疑惑
Dialogue: 0,0:18:26.89,0:18:29.57,Chinese,,0,0,0,,"警告！你的图案无法与CD相适配
Dialogue: 0,0:18:29.57,0:18:33.17,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你是否想打开设置，重新调整直径
Dialogue: 0,0:18:33.17,0:18:35.79,Chinese,,0,0,0,,或是在空余位置刻录上部分图像？"
Dialogue: 0,0:18:35.79,0:18:37.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我看就刻录一部分图像吧
Dialogue: 0,0:18:37.32,0:18:39.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,"或是不再刻录图片了？"
Dialogue: 0,0:18:39.72,0:18:41.17,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不不，刻录是一定的!
Dialogue: 0,0:18:41.17,0:18:42.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,还是编辑一下吧
Dialogue: 0,0:18:43.64,0:18:47.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我在想它会不会......是这样的
Dialogue: 0,0:18:47.72,0:18:51.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好的，这就是调整半径之后的结果了
Dialogue: 0,0:18:54.19,0:18:59.64,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这就是调整后的位图了
Dialogue: 0,0:18:59.64,0:19:06.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,想不到就在光盘最外层刻上那么一小圈，也是那么的耗时
Dialogue: 0,0:19:06.98,0:19:12.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好的，花了不到3分钟就刻完了，大约是两分半
Dialogue: 0,0:19:14.39,0:19:15.49,Chinese,,0,0,0,,看看成果吧
Dialogue: 0,0:19:17.46,0:19:20.01,Chinese,,0,0,0,,X﹏X
Dialogue: 0,0:19:20.01,0:19:25.01,Chinese,,0,0,0,,甚至比第一张还差:-(
Dialogue: 0,0:19:25.12,0:19:26.69,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你嘛也看不见！
Dialogue: 0,0:19:26.69,0:19:29.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你看啊，就这边缘位置，你可以大致看到些文字
Dialogue: 0,0:19:30.12,0:19:34.37,Chinese,,0,0,0,,“这是个更小的DiscT@2”
Dialogue: 0,0:19:39.77,0:19:42.33,Chinese,,0,0,0,,就这样，这张盘就说到这
Dialogue: 0,0:19:42.33,0:19:43.41,Chinese,,0,0,0,,颜色也许挺酷的
Dialogue: 0,0:19:43.41,0:19:47.28,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是刻上去的图案太浅了，不太好
Dialogue: 0,0:19:47.28,0:19:50.97,Chinese,,0,0,0,,再看看这个蓝色AZO染料的光盘
Dialogue: 0,0:19:50.97,0:19:57.53,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你就明白为啥雅马哈推荐这种盘，并售卖自己的DiscT@2光盘
Dialogue: 0,0:19:57.53,0:19:59.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,再看看，这是观看刻上图片的最佳形式
Dialogue: 0,0:19:59.38,0:20:01.08,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这可真是理想状态哦
Dialogue: 0,0:20:01.08,0:20:02.71,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过这可不是现实中看到的样子
Dialogue: 0,0:20:02.71,0:20:08.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个只是照相机拍到的顶灯反射在光盘上的样子
Dialogue: 0,0:20:08.44,0:20:11.42,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好的，这就是DiscT@2了
Dialogue: 0,0:20:15.01,0:20:17.47,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好的，这就是我体验这个光驱的过程了
Dialogue: 0,0:20:17.47,0:20:21.48,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这台 CRW-F1 ，当时最好的光驱之一
Dialogue: 0,0:20:21.48,0:20:26.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,尽管使用的是落后的SCSI接口，搁现在也是好玩意啊
Dialogue: 0,0:20:26.38,0:20:32.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过，DiscT@2这个小花活呢，基本没啥用
Dialogue: 0,0:20:32.26,0:20:36.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你可以从某些老物件回顾纪录片中看到这玩意的来龙去脉
Dialogue: 0,0:20:36.12,0:20:39.85,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但你看这成果，真的是难堪大用啊
Dialogue: 0,0:20:39.85,0:20:47.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你很难从当时流行的普通CD-R上看到你刻上去的图案啊
Dialogue: 0,0:20:47.04,0:20:52.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,如果你用了雅马哈推荐的昂贵刻录盘的话，效果倒是还行
Dialogue: 0,0:20:52.32,0:20:57.75,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好吧，就这玩意，我有点怀疑观众朋友们到底有没有用过:-P
Dialogue: 0,0:20:57.75,0:21:04.63,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，我之后是用过LightScribe，但这俩可不是一类东西啊
Dialogue: 0,0:21:04.63,0:21:08.21,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而且还在数据区上浪费那么多的空间，毫无意义
Dialogue: 0,0:21:08.21,0:21:13.42,Chinese,,0,0,0,,值得被列入我的"志异"系列，希望大家"看得"愉快
Dialogue: 0,0:21:14.74,0:21:16.76,Chinese,,0,0,0,,......看视频愉快啦
