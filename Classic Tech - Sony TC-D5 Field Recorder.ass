Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.96,0:00:11.32,English,,0,0,0,,If you assembled a group of people and asked them to describe a "portable cassette player,"
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.32,0:00:15.36,English,,0,0,0,,it's more than likely they'd tell you about a Walkman or a boombox.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.58,0:00:19.78,English,,0,0,0,,However, if you asked the same group to describe a "high end cassette recorder,"
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.16,0:00:22.88,English,,0,0,0,,they'd probably tell you about a hi-fi component.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.12,0:00:26.82,English,,0,0,0,,However, there is one type of cassette recorder that's both those things.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.84,0:00:30.12,English,,0,0,0,,It's high end and it's portable, and, no surprise,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.12,0:00:32.44,English,,0,0,0,,I've got one here today to show you,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.44,0:00:35.44,English,,0,0,0,,this is the Sony TC-D5.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.48,0:00:36.66,English,,0,0,0,,Let's take a look at it.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.12,0:00:49.46,English,,0,0,0,,Now, the Sony TC-D5 isn't just one cassette model, it's a total of four.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.46,0:00:53.72,English,,0,0,0,,The version I've got here is the Pro II. This is the last revision.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.82,0:00:59.22,English,,0,0,0,,However, the original one that came out in 1978 was just called the TC-D5.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.54,0:01:06.32,English,,0,0,0,,That was revised in 1980 to the TC-D5M, which meant it could record onto metal tapes.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.46,0:01:09.96,English,,0,0,0,,That one carried on being sold until 2005 approximately,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.10,0:01:16.46,English,,0,0,0,,but it forked in 1982. There was a Pro model issued which had XLR microphone inputs,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.46,0:01:22.88,English,,0,0,0,,and that was revised in 1986 and carried on to some time around about 1999, or maybe a little bit beyond there.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.88,0:01:25.14,English,,0,0,0,,So putting aside the more technical differences for the moment,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.14,0:01:28.76,English,,0,0,0,,things like different record heads and microphone amplification circuitry, things like that,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.96,0:01:32.54,English,,0,0,0,,your average chap industry is more interested in the fact that your
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.80,0:01:36.74,English,,0,0,0,,"Pro" and "Pro II" only have XLR mic level inputs,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.74,0:01:43.48,English,,0,0,0,,whereas the "prosumer" versions, the original and the M, have line level RCA inputs.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.68,0:01:45.18,English,,0,0,0,,And, outputs of course.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.34,0:01:48.68,English,,0,0,0,,Let's just take a step back for the moment and talk about field recorders in general
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.68,0:01:50.26,English,,0,0,0,,because they are still in use.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.54,0:01:52.78,English,,0,0,0,,Of course, nowadays people tend to use digital ones,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.88,0:01:55.72,English,,0,0,0,,some of these microphones will be for radio stations,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.72,0:01:58.58,English,,0,0,0,,they don't need to record video, so they just record onto a digital recorder.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.58,0:02:01.62,English,,0,0,0,,And the same would have gone for back in the eighties.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.68,0:02:04.70,English,,0,0,0,,People would have been using cassette recorders for that purpose.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.80,0:02:09.16,English,,0,0,0,,It was perfectly acceptable to use them for radio broadcasts. The quality was good enough for that.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.64,0:02:13.90,English,,0,0,0,,Of course, before then, people used reel-to-reel recorders and field recorders have existed
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.90,0:02:16.70,English,,0,0,0,,pretty much as long as recording itself has.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.88,0:02:22.82,English,,0,0,0,,Of course, back in the sixties and seventies, when the TV news quite often relied on 16 mm film,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.86,0:02:26.72,English,,0,0,0,,you'd have a separate sound chap recording the audio separate to the camera.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.92,0:02:32.04,English,,0,0,0,,But of course, later on, we started synchronizing the video and the sound onto one device,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.06,0:02:35.26,English,,0,0,0,,so field recorders tended to be used more just for radio.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.26,0:02:37.74,English,,0,0,0,,It wasn't that long ago that I was interviewed in the street like this.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.74,0:02:41.22,English,,0,0,0,,...I mean, not dressed up like a woman, like the comedian Dick Emery,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.42,0:02:44.64,English,,0,0,0,,but no, with a reporter coming up to me with a microphone in one hand,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.64,0:02:46.78,English,,0,0,0,,cassette recorder slung over their shoulder.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.94,0:02:49.46,English,,0,0,0,,That was for something on local radio news.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.62,0:02:53.50,English,,0,0,0,,At the time the D5 came out, many of the rivals were only capable of recording in mono.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.70,0:02:56.74,English,,0,0,0,,The D5 was capable of good quality stereo recording,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.76,0:03:01.12,English,,0,0,0,,and therefore often put to good use in the tapers' section at a Grateful Dead concert.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.12,0:03:05.58,English,,0,0,0,,And another early adopter of the D5 was Sony co-founder Masaru Ibuka,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.60,0:03:08.36,English,,0,0,0,,who took one along with him on his business trips
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.36,0:03:11.50,English,,0,0,0,,with a set of headphones to listen to classical music.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.50,0:03:14.20,English,,0,0,0,,It had a good, long battery life but it was a little bit bulky,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.20,0:03:19.32,English,,0,0,0,,and he mentioned this in early 1979 to  Akio Morita, who was the chairman,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.32,0:03:22.82,English,,0,0,0,,and that resulted in Sony developing their first Walkman.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.88,0:03:25.84,English,,0,0,0,,So just think, if the D5 hadn't existed,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.84,0:03:28.68,English,,0,0,0,,perhaps the Walkman would never have happened.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.04,0:03:33.34,English,,0,0,0,,Sony called the TC-D5 the "ultimate portable cassette deck,"
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.52,0:03:38.12,English,,0,0,0,,and kept using that tagline throughout its life, and it was a long life as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.32,0:03:45.18,English,,0,0,0,,Looking back through the old Sony catalogs, you can see the D5 there in the 1980's and the 1990's.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.26,0:03:49.06,English,,0,0,0,,All the other products in the catalog completely changed during that time,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.14,0:03:52.18,English,,0,0,0,,whereas the D5 remains constant throughout.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.18,0:03:54.94,English,,0,0,0,,If it was a car, it would be like the Land Rover.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.94,0:03:58.14,English,,0,0,0,,It looked very similar to the models that came out decades before,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.14,0:04:01.56,English,,0,0,0,,but there was no need to change it because they got it right first time.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.56,0:04:04.22,English,,0,0,0,,And the same could be said for the D5.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.76,0:04:07.90,English,,0,0,0,,But when it comes to the, normally, fast-moving world of consumer electronics,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.90,0:04:10.22,English,,0,0,0,,the D5 is a bit of an anomaly.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.42,0:04:17.00,English,,0,0,0,,When it was first launched in 1978 when the BBC were using reel-to-reel recorders for their field work,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.10,0:04:22.58,English,,0,0,0,,and then it existed throughout the years of the Walkman and the small dictaphones
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.78,0:04:24.68,English,,0,0,0,,and carried on throughout,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.68,0:04:27.38,English,,0,0,0,,all the way through into the 21st century.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.38,0:04:29.92,English,,0,0,0,,I've even found it mentioned in this B&H catalog
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.92,0:04:33.02,English,,0,0,0,,where you can find professional MiniDisc recorders,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.02,0:04:37.74,English,,0,0,0,,DAT recorders, CD-Rs, hard drives; but alongside all those,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.74,0:04:40.92,English,,0,0,0,,it's still there, the D5 Pro II.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.02,0:04:45.90,English,,0,0,0,,Now, the reason I chose the Pro II over the other models in the range is because it was the last revision.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.90,0:04:48.78,English,,0,0,0,,It actually came out in 1986.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.78,0:04:52.48,English,,0,0,0,,The D5M was last revised in 1980.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.76,0:04:58.70,English,,0,0,0,,The Pro II has a couple of improvements, such as the recording circuitry, better quality heads,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.70,0:05:01.98,English,,0,0,0,,a shield over the heads to stop interference from buzzing, things like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.24,0:05:06.90,English,,0,0,0,,But the Pro models were only generally available through specialist outlets like B&H.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.00,0:05:09.60,English,,0,0,0,,If you go on the Sony website, they still do "pro" products,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.60,0:05:14.04,English,,0,0,0,,you've got to go past the normal "consumer" stuff, down to the bottom here you can see the pro range,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.04,0:05:17.22,English,,0,0,0,,and the stuff there is really for broadcasters.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.22,0:05:20.82,English,,0,0,0,,And if you have a look at some of the prices on this, you can see why they classed it as pro.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.04,0:05:24.82,English,,0,0,0,,For example, this point-of-view camera is $75,000.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.82,0:05:30.64,English,,0,0,0,,So yeah, you can see this "pro" cassette recorder is designed for that market, and it feels quality as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.70,0:05:33.80,English,,0,0,0,,The whole thing is made out of metal. There's a couple of bits of plastic here and there,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.80,0:05:38.14,English,,0,0,0,,but really, the whole body and the structure of the thing is just solid.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.34,0:05:41.44,English,,0,0,0,,It's designed to take a kick and keep on recording.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.70,0:05:44.76,English,,0,0,0,,Along the bottom here, you can see this section is made out of a rubber,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.76,0:05:48.24,English,,0,0,0,,and that's a kind of protective bumper because when you hold it on your side,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.24,0:05:51.08,English,,0,0,0,,if you were to drop it, that's the part it would land on.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.28,0:05:54.40,English,,0,0,0,,Even the battery compartment has a metal cover.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.44,0:05:57.42,English,,0,0,0,,Might not sound like a big deal, but very rare to see that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.42,0:06:01.22,English,,0,0,0,,The batteries inside here are two standard "D" cells,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.22,0:06:05.52,English,,0,0,0,,which will power it for approximately 4 and 1/2  to 5 hours.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.84,0:06:08.32,English,,0,0,0,,There are, of course, advantages to using off-the-shelf batteries like these
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.32,0:06:10.70,English,,0,0,0,,as opposed to having a rechargeable device,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.70,0:06:13.54,English,,0,0,0,,especially if you've got your field recorder in the middle of nowhere,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.54,0:06:15.88,English,,0,0,0,,somewhere where there's no power.  How would you recharge anything?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.08,0:06:18.74,English,,0,0,0,,You could always carry along a few extra batteries with you, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.24,0:06:23.10,English,,0,0,0,,And also I noticed in this article it was about recording audio for the radio.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.10,0:06:27.16,English,,0,0,0,,They mentioned that after the tsunami, the only machine that was still working was the D5
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.24,0:06:30.90,English,,0,0,0,,when their more modern MiniDisc and DAT machines had already given up.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.46,0:06:36.90,English,,0,0,0,,I should also mention that both my Pro II model and the D5M can be run off DC power.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.90,0:06:39.78,English,,0,0,0,,However, I don't think the same goes for the original Pro.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.78,0:06:44.50,English,,0,0,0,,Where mine's got a DC power jack, that's got a stereo and mono switch.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.88,0:06:46.66,English,,0,0,0,,Right, so I want to show you something now.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.66,0:06:50.22,English,,0,0,0,,I've taken the Pro II outside, I've got something recorded on this cassette.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.22,0:06:54.74,English,,0,0,0,,I'm going to play it into the camera and, just have a listen to this for a moment.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.04,0:07:00.00,English,,0,0,0,,[Playback]: "If you want to develop a professional field recorder,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.00,0:07:02.75,English,,0,0,0,,you can't just take a typical cassette mechanism
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.75,0:07:05.38,English,,0,0,0,,and plonk it into a case along with some batteries.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.38,0:07:07.48,English,,0,0,0,,No, because as soon as you were to move it,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.48,0:07:09.32,English,,0,0,0,,the sound would become wobbly.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.38,0:07:11.60,English,,0,0,0,,This is due to variations in the tape speed.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.60,0:07:15.12,English,,0,0,0,,It's something more commonly referred to as "wow" and "flutter."
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.12,0:07:19.64,English,,0,0,0,,Shaking the D5 though has no effect. The playback speed is unaltered,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.84,0:07:23.46,English,,0,0,0,,and this is thanks to a new type of drive mechanism that Sony developed
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.46,0:07:24.98,English,,0,0,0,,just for this machine.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.98,0:07:29.50,English,,0,0,0,,This kind of performance was vital for a device that has to record broadcast-quality audio
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.50,0:07:32.06,English,,0,0,0,,whether it's at a press conference sat on a table,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.06,0:07:36.96,English,,0,0,0,,or slung over the shoulder of a reporter running through a war zone.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.64,0:07:40.84,English,,0,0,0,,Now that really was quite impressive!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.84,0:07:43.98,English,,0,0,0,,Of course nowadays though, when people are listening to solid state devices
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.98,0:07:46.94,English,,0,0,0,,with no moving parts, it doesn't quite have the same impact.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.06,0:07:49.90,English,,0,0,0,,But when this thing came out, that was a bit of a revelation.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.90,0:07:54.08,English,,0,0,0,,It's all down to this very clever motor mechanism, which I can't even begin to explain to you
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.08,0:07:55.74,English,,0,0,0,,because I don't quite understand it myself.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.74,0:07:59.00,English,,0,0,0,,But it's kind of a direct drive kind of thing. You've got a wheel, you've got another thing
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.00,0:08:03.08,English,,0,0,0,,that's attached to the wheel, which drives it in a certain way that doesn't get affected by
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.08,0:08:05.58,English,,0,0,0,,movement or gravity or things.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.58,0:08:12.52,English,,0,0,0,,All very clever, and later on employed in the Sony D6C Professional Walkman as well,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.52,0:08:17.66,English,,0,0,0,,but I can't really demonstrate it or show you how it works, so let's just put the cover back on here.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.66,0:08:20.08,English,,0,0,0,,But I will show you around the machine itself.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.28,0:08:22.62,English,,0,0,0,,If we start off on the left hand side,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.62,0:08:25.54,English,,0,0,0,,we can see we've got a little part that's sticking out of there,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.54,0:08:30.34,English,,0,0,0,,and that's to attach a strap to so you can put it over a shoulder. There's one on the other side as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.76,0:08:35.32,English,,0,0,0,,At the bottom corner we've got a 6.5 mm stereo headphone jack and above that there's a

Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.82,0:08:40.84,English,,0,0,0,,which also affects the volume of the speaker on the top.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.84,0:08:45.70,English,,0,0,0,,It's just a mono speaker really designed just for listening back to what you've recorded to check there's something there.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:45.70,0:08:47.34,English,,0,0,0,,It's not a high quality speaker.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.54,0:08:52.54,English,,0,0,0,,The keys on this are the typical piano key design, which was popular in the 70's,

Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.38,0:08:59.66,English,,0,0,0,,This is basic, but it's basic because it worked and it doesn't go wrong.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.74,0:09:03.60,English,,0,0,0,,Over on the right hand side, we've got the twin VU meters for the left and right stereo
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.60,0:09:06.86,English,,0,0,0,,and a couple of other controls I'll show you a little bit later on.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.18,0:09:09.42,English,,0,0,0,,There's no button to open the cassette door. However,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.42,0:09:13.32,English,,0,0,0,,once you've opened it manually, you can see we've got a couple of additional lever switches in here,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.32,0:09:17.46,English,,0,0,0,,one of which turns Dolby B on or off, and the other one selects tape formulations,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.46,0:09:20.20,English,,0,0,0,,between type I and type III.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.40,0:09:25.38,English,,0,0,0,,You might remember type III being the shortly-lived formulation, that wasn't on the market all that long.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.58,0:09:30.04,English,,0,0,0,,However, this also automatically identifies type II, which is chrome tape,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.18,0:09:34.86,English,,0,0,0,,from this little lever at the back. It can play back metal tapes, but it can't record to them.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:34.86,0:09:41.32,English,,0,0,0,,If you want to record to metal tapes, then you'll need the TC-D5M, the "M" standing for "metal."
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.70,0:09:44.62,English,,0,0,0,,It's a bit unusual that the prosumer model can record to metal,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.62,0:09:47.91,English,,0,0,0,,whereas the professional model can't,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.92,0:09:51.34,English,,0,0,0,,and some people say that's perhaps because you need more power to record to metal,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.34,0:09:53.34,English,,0,0,0,,so the batteries can last a little bit longer,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:53.54,0:09:57.96,English,,0,0,0,,and it doesn't really matter anymore nowadays because it's very hard to find metal tapes,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:57.96,0:10:00.84,English,,0,0,0,,and since you can play them back and record to chrome and ferric,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:00.84,0:10:03.84,English,,0,0,0,,that's pretty much all you need in a deck nowadays.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.84,0:10:05.96,English,,0,0,0,,And then when it comes to playing back tapes,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.16,0:10:11.98,English,,0,0,0,,this diminutive little machine puts in an excellent performance whether it's tape type I, II, III, or IV.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.98,0:10:16.86,English,,0,0,0,,As long as the original recording was done to a high standard, this thing will reproduce a sound,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.94,0:10:21.44,English,,0,0,0,,the kind of which you don't even tend to get out of most home hi-fi decks.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.64,0:10:26.22,English,,0,0,0,,And it looks good while it's doing it. I'm a sucker for these bouncing VU needles.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.32,0:10:29.70,English,,0,0,0,,I'll also point out that the left hand one is a battery indicator.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.90,0:10:33.62,English,,0,0,0,,If you press this button, you can see the needle stays in position to show you
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.62,0:10:36.26,English,,0,0,0,,how much battery power you've got left in there.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:36.26,0:10:42.34,English,,0,0,0,,And it also turns on a little backlight, although it is quite dim, as you can see here, and it's only on momentarily.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.88,0:10:44.44,English,,0,0,0,,Once you've used this machine for a while,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:44.44,0:10:48.00,English,,0,0,0,,you really start to get an appreciation for some of the finer details.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:48.00,0:10:50.36,English,,0,0,0,,Little basic things, like this eject button here.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:50.36,0:10:54.36,English,,0,0,0,,All it is is a simple lever that's designed to pop the cassette out of the machine,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:54.36,0:10:56.76,English,,0,0,0,,but it's just such a simple little mechanism that works,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:56.76,0:10:59.70,English,,0,0,0,,why bother doing anything different?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.76,0:11:03.72,English,,0,0,0,,Now, of course, if you're playing back any music through this, you don't want to be doing it
Dialogue: 0,0:11:03.72,0:11:08.60,English,,0,0,0,,through that built-in speaker, because it's just a tinny little speaker that's designed so that you can tell
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.80,0:11:10.14,English,,0,0,0,,that there's something on the tape.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:10.50,0:11:13.40,English,,0,0,0,,You really want to plug it into some sort of external amplifier
Dialogue: 0,0:11:13.40,0:11:18.60,English,,0,0,0,,or you could just plug those RCA plugs into external powered speakers like I've got here,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:18.60,0:11:20.28,English,,0,0,0,,and it makes a heck of a difference.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:27.08,0:11:30.82,English,,0,0,0,,One reason I used this machine when I was demonstrating the Atari Video Music the other week
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.02,0:11:34.60,English,,0,0,0,,is because you can have two live audio outputs at the same time,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:34.60,0:11:39.28,English,,0,0,0,,so I could plug the RCA outputs into the Atari and the headphone output came out of the front
Dialogue: 0,0:11:39.28,0:11:42.20,English,,0,0,0,,and into the camera that I was recording everything with.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:42.26,0:11:45.48,English,,0,0,0,,Talking of recording, you've got a record level dial here,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:45.48,0:11:47.90,English,,0,0,0,,made out of metal. It's sort of gunmetal, in a way.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:47.90,0:11:51.78,English,,0,0,0,,The whole thing feels a little bit military at times. It's just so well put together.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:51.78,0:11:54.29,English,,0,0,0,,But, as you can see, you can adjust the left and right separately,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:54.30,0:11:57.46,English,,0,0,0,,and of course, during interviews, they might have had one microphone for one person,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:57.46,0:11:59.86,English,,0,0,0,,one for the other and you could have adjusted the levels;
Dialogue: 0,0:12:00.06,0:12:01.92,English,,0,0,0,,however, if you want to plug something into this,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:01.92,0:12:08.72,English,,0,0,0,,you can get a lead which will convert RCA into microphone balanced XLR inputs;
Dialogue: 0,0:12:08.72,0:12:11.86,English,,0,0,0,,however, once you plug those into an output,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:11.98,0:12:17.86,English,,0,0,0,,say, from a line out from a CD player, like I'm doing here, and then plug the other end into the D5,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:17.86,0:12:23.98,English,,0,0,0,,you find that line level outputs are a lot "hotter," a lot louder than microphone level
Dialogue: 0,0:12:23.98,0:12:27.00,English,,0,0,0,,so that, if I put pause on here and pressed record,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:27.00,0:12:29.68,English,,0,0,0,,you can see that it's just peaking the whole thing out completely.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:29.68,0:12:33.32,English,,0,0,0,,We've got the peak light shining at the top there as well, next to the record light.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:33.32,0:12:37.04,English,,0,0,0,,You can see, if I just turn it up slightly, it's just straight into the peaks.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:37.18,0:12:43.26,English,,0,0,0,,So, the line level output needs to be brought down to the level of a mic level input.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:43.54,0:12:46.78,English,,0,0,0,,Fortunately, they've got this switch on the side here which takes 20 decibels off it,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:46.84,0:12:52.86,English,,0,0,0,,so if we do that, we can bring it down to a level the device is supposed to record at.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:52.86,0:12:56.74,English,,0,0,0,,Now, I'm not sure whether I'm supposed to be doing it this way, but it does seem to work fine
Dialogue: 0,0:12:56.74,0:13:00.54,English,,0,0,0,,so I'm just going to carry on. But yeah. You've also got a limiter at the bottom right.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:00.54,0:13:03.64,English,,0,0,0,,Notice if I turn this all the way up, we have it so it's peaking out,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:03.64,0:13:08.44,English,,0,0,0,,turn the limiter on, and it will try and keep it back within normal recording level parameters.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:08.58,0:13:10.60,English,,0,0,0,,That's for if you're at some sort of loud concert,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:10.80,0:13:13.54,English,,0,0,0,,or somewhere where there's gonna be loud noises every now and then.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:13.54,0:13:17.34,English,,0,0,0,,You want it just to limit those so doesn't oversaturate the recording.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:18.30,0:13:20.90,English,,0,0,0,,You might have noticed that my machine is in really good condition.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:20.90,0:13:24.94,English,,0,0,0,,In fact, the only marks on it are these little two scratches on the top here in the black paint.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:24.94,0:13:27.72,English,,0,0,0,,But that's it. And the reason that it's in such good condition
Dialogue: 0,0:13:27.92,0:13:30.34,English,,0,0,0,,is because it was kept in its protective case.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:30.34,0:13:32.52,English,,0,0,0,,That's one of the great things about field recorders.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:32.52,0:13:36.88,English,,0,0,0,,They all came with one of these protective cases, so as long as the person who owned it before you
Dialogue: 0,0:13:36.88,0:13:39.80,English,,0,0,0,,kept it in there, there's a good chance that it won't have got these scratches and marks
Dialogue: 0,0:13:39.86,0:13:43.28,English,,0,0,0,,that something of this age would usually have by now.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:43.58,0:13:45.58,English,,0,0,0,,As you can see, once you put it inside the case,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:45.58,0:13:48.70,English,,0,0,0,,the original strap connectors go through holes in there,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:48.70,0:13:51.98,English,,0,0,0,,and then your strap is supposed to attach to the connectors on the case itself.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:52.34,0:13:57.34,English,,0,0,0,,My case has got a few scratches and nicks in it. The leather's started to peel away in places,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:57.34,0:13:59.36,English,,0,0,0,,but it's done its job. It's protected the machine.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:59.56,0:14:04.12,English,,0,0,0,,In fact, you can even replace the cassettes inside the deck without taking it out of the case.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:04.16,0:14:08.04,English,,0,0,0,,The only thing you'll need to take it out for, really, is to replace the batteries.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:08.52,0:14:13.66,English,,0,0,0,,Now while Sony might have had the D5 on the market longer than any other rival model,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:13.66,0:14:19.44,English,,0,0,0,,there were quite a few other machines that came and went during its lifetime, from a number of different manufacturers.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:19.44,0:14:23.10,English,,0,0,0,,One of the more respected of those was Marantz, and this model here
Dialogue: 0,0:14:23.30,0:14:27.44,English,,0,0,0,,does bear quite a striking resemblance  to the D5 in places.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:27.44,0:14:31.84,English,,0,0,0,,The model is the CP430, that's the European model number,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:32.04,0:14:34.84,English,,0,0,0,,in the US it was known as the PMD430.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:34.84,0:14:38.84,English,,0,0,0,,It does Dolby B, but it also does dbx.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:39.04,0:14:42.46,English,,0,0,0,,This is the only dbx machine I've got, I only picked this up a couple of weeks ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:42.46,0:14:45.88,English,,0,0,0,,It's quite high end. It does chrome and metal recording as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:45.88,0:14:50.03,English,,0,0,0,,You can see down at the bottom here we've got a pitch and a bias control on there,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:50.04,0:14:52.80,English,,0,0,0,,and it's also a 3 head machine.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:52.80,0:14:57.08,English,,0,0,0,,So that means I can listen back to the recordings that it's making as it's making them.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:57.12,0:15:00.25,English,,0,0,0,,And you just press that button down there to listen to either the tape
Dialogue: 0,0:15:00.25,0:15:02.36,English,,0,0,0,,or the source.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:02.36,0:15:06.52,English,,0,0,0,,So when it comes to features, it appears that this device has the Sony beaten hands-down.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:06.52,0:15:10.72,English,,0,0,0,,However, when it comes to build quality, the Sony is clearly the victor.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:10.96,0:15:13.10,English,,0,0,0,,Where the Sony's got a solid metal construction,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:13.30,0:15:16.22,English,,0,0,0,,this has a flimsy, creaky plastic one.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:16.42,0:15:18.12,English,,0,0,0,,The Sony feels like a metal brick,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:18.12,0:15:20.24,English,,0,0,0,,this feels like an empty plastic box.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:20.24,0:15:23.84,English,,0,0,0,,And after reading up a little bit online, it seems like the wow and flutter numbers
Dialogue: 0,0:15:24.00,0:15:26.60,English,,0,0,0,,aren't that impressive for this machine, either.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:26.84,0:15:29.74,English,,0,0,0,,Something else I'd learned while doing  a bit of research for this video:
Dialogue: 0,0:15:32.48,0:15:34.39,English,,0,0,0,,You know, earlier on I mentioned the BBC used these Uher 4400 recorders.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:34.40,0:15:39.60,English,,0,0,0,,I've even seen those for sale on eBay saying "ex-BBC" and they've got all the stamps and things on them.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:39.60,0:15:42.60,English,,0,0,0,,Well, when they replaced those, they didn't use the D5.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:42.78,0:15:47.34,English,,0,0,0,,No, instead, they used its smaller newer brother the Sony D6C.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:47.40,0:15:49.98,English,,0,0,0,,Which is classed as a professional Walkman,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:49.98,0:15:53.04,English,,0,0,0,,but really it's a very sophisticated little portable recorder,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:53.04,0:16:00.66,English,,0,0,0,,able to record using Dolby C and record onto metal-- both things that I can't do with my D5.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:01.18,0:16:04.36,English,,0,0,0,,But I will talk more about the D6C in a future video.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:04.36,0:16:07.22,English,,0,0,0,,I plan on doing a video where I talk about the Walkman,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:07.22,0:16:10.96,English,,0,0,0,,and I'll feature it in that one, but getting back to the D5.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:10.96,0:16:13.02,English,,0,0,0,,I think it's time to do the wrap-up.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:14.62,0:16:20.43,English,,0,0,0,,There are still plenty of people out there that, for one reason or another, need a decent quality cassette deck.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:20.47,0:16:24.36,English,,0,0,0,,But if you go looking to buy a new one, nowadays, there's very little choice.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:24.36,0:16:28.48,English,,0,0,0,,You've got your cheap, plasticky novelties, the things that convert tapes to MP3s,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:28.68,0:16:33.72,English,,0,0,0,,and one of the things that people have asked me to review a lot is the elbow cassette player,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:33.72,0:16:36.78,English,,0,0,0,,but that's just a design concept at the moment.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:36.78,0:16:40.68,English,,0,0,0,,Pretend it's like a concept car at a motor show. You can't buy it,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:40.78,0:16:44.22,English,,0,0,0,,and whether or not anything like that will ever come to the market in the future?
Dialogue: 0,0:16:44.22,0:16:45.94,English,,0,0,0,,We'll just have to wait and see on that one.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:45.94,0:16:49.86,English,,0,0,0,,As far as things you can go in a real shop somewhere in the world and buy?
Dialogue: 0,0:16:49.86,0:16:54.34,English,,0,0,0,,Well, in the US, you can go get the Tascam CD-A580.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:54.34,0:16:56.58,English,,0,0,0,,That costs $400 over there,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:56.58,0:17:02.38,English,,0,0,0,,and it doesn't have any kind of Dolby noise reduction circuitry and I'd imagine that's perhaps down to some sort of licensing issues.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:02.38,0:17:04.96,English,,0,0,0,,My preference, though, would be to go for something older.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:04.96,0:17:09.52,English,,0,0,0,,But even if you go back to 1990, you're still talking 27 years old,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:09.61,0:17:16.20,English,,0,0,0,,so you got to buy something that was top-quality back in the day if it's going to be working perfectly nowadays,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:16.20,0:17:19.74,English,,0,0,0,,and you won't get much better quality than one of these things.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:20.29,0:17:26.00,English,,0,0,0,,Now they quite often get overlooked when it comes to second-hand tape players because they don't look particularly impressive.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.46,0:00:53.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我搞来的是Pro II，这个系列的最新型号
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.82,0:00:59.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然而，初版机器是在1978年问世的，当时叫做TC-D5
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.54,0:01:06.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在1980年，改进型号TC-D5M问世，这个可以将声音录进金属磁带

Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.10,0:01:16.46,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是1982年，又分出个新型号。新的Pro型号可以输入XLR麦克风信号

Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.34,0:01:48.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在，让我们先停下脚步，咱先来谈谈户外录音机到底是啥
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.68,0:01:50.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因为他们现在仍在使用
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.54,0:01:52.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，现在人们更倾向用数字录音版的
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.88,0:01:55.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,有一些麦克风是用在广播站的
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.72,0:01:58.58,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他们不需要录像，将声音录在数码录音机上就OK了
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.58,0:02:01.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在上世纪80年代，这个道理也是适用的
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.68,0:02:04.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而人们更希望使用磁带录音机来完成这个目标
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.80,0:02:09.16,Chinese,,0,0,0,,对于广播来说，这就够用了，录音效果也还行
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.64,0:02:13.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，在这之前，人们用过卷盘式录音机来录音
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.90,0:02:16.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而户外录音机的历史正如录音技术的一样长
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.88,0:02:22.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,咱再回到六七十年代，当时电视经常使用16mm胶卷来录像
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.86,0:02:26.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,you'd have a separate sound chap recording the audio separate to the camera.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.92,0:02:32.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,But of course, later on, we started synchronizing the video and the sound onto one device,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.06,0:02:35.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,so field recorders tended to be used more just for radio.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.26,0:02:37.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,It wasn't that long ago that I was interviewed in the street like this.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.94,0:02:49.46,Chinese,,0,0,0,,That was for something on local radio news.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.62,0:02:53.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,At the time the D5 came out, many of the rivals were only capable of recording in mono.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.70,0:02:56.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,The D5 was capable of good quality stereo recording,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.76,0:03:01.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,and therefore often put to good use in the tapers' section at a Grateful Dead concert.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.12,0:03:05.58,Chinese,,0,0,0,,And another early adopter of the D5 was Sony co-founder Masaru Ibuka,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.60,0:03:08.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,who took one along with him on his business trips
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.36,0:03:11.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,with a set of headphones to listen to classical music.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.50,0:03:14.20,Chinese,,0,0,0,,It had a good, long battery life but it was a little bit bulky,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.20,0:03:19.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,and he mentioned this in early 1979 to  Akio Morita, who was the chairman,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.32,0:03:22.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,and that resulted in Sony developing their first Walkman.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.88,0:03:25.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,So just think, if the D5 hadn't existed,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.84,0:03:28.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,perhaps the Walkman would never have happened.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.04,0:03:33.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Sony called the TC-D5 the "ultimate portable cassette deck,"
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.52,0:03:38.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,and kept using that tagline throughout its life, and it was a long life as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.32,0:03:45.18,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Looking back through the old Sony catalogs, you can see the D5 there in the 1980's and the 1990's.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.26,0:03:49.06,Chinese,,0,0,0,,All the other products in the catalog completely changed during that time,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.14,0:03:52.18,Chinese,,0,0,0,,whereas the D5 remains constant throughout.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.18,0:03:54.94,Chinese,,0,0,0,,If it was a car, it would be like the Land Rover.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.94,0:03:58.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,It looked very similar to the models that came out decades before,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.14,0:04:01.56,Chinese,,0,0,0,,but there was no need to change it because they got it right first time.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.56,0:04:04.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,And the same could be said for the D5.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.76,0:04:07.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,But when it comes to the, normally, fast-moving world of consumer electronics,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.90,0:04:10.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,the D5 is a bit of an anomaly.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.42,0:04:17.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,When it was first launched in 1978 when the BBC were using reel-to-reel recorders for their field work,

Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.78,0:04:24.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,and carried on throughout,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.68,0:04:27.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,all the way through into the 21st century.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.38,0:04:29.92,Chinese,,0,0,0,,I've even found it mentioned in this B&H catalog
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.92,0:04:33.02,Chinese,,0,0,0,,where you can find professional MiniDisc recorders,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.02,0:04:37.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,DAT recorders, CD-Rs, hard drives; but alongside all those,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.74,0:04:40.92,Chinese,,0,0,0,,it's still there, the D5 Pro II.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.02,0:04:45.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Now, the reason I chose the Pro II over the other models in the range is because it was the last revision.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.90,0:04:48.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,It actually came out in 1986.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.78,0:04:52.48,Chinese,,0,0,0,,The D5M was last revised in 1980.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.76,0:04:58.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,The Pro II has a couple of improvements, such as the recording circuitry, better quality heads,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.70,0:05:01.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,a shield over the heads to stop interference from buzzing, things like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.24,0:05:06.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,But the Pro models were only generally available through specialist outlets like B&H.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.00,0:05:09.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,If you go on the Sony website, they still do "pro" products,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.60,0:05:14.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,you've got to go past the normal "consumer" stuff, down to the bottom here you can see the pro range,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.04,0:05:17.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,and the stuff there is really for broadcasters.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.22,0:05:20.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,And if you have a look at some of the prices on this, you can see why they classed it as pro.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.04,0:05:24.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,For example, this point-of-view camera is $75,000.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.82,0:05:30.64,Chinese,,0,0,0,,So yeah, you can see this "pro" cassette recorder is designed for that market, and it feels quality as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.70,0:05:33.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,The whole thing is made out of metal. There's a couple of bits of plastic here and there,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.80,0:05:38.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,but really, the whole body and the structure of the thing is just solid.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.34,0:05:41.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,It's designed to take a kick and keep on recording.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.70,0:05:44.76,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Along the bottom here, you can see this section is made out of a rubber,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.76,0:05:48.24,Chinese,,0,0,0,,and that's a kind of protective bumper because when you hold it on your side,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.24,0:05:51.08,Chinese,,0,0,0,,if you were to drop it, that's the part it would land on.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.28,0:05:54.40,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Even the battery compartment has a metal cover.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.44,0:05:57.42,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Might not sound like a big deal, but very rare to see that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.42,0:06:01.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,The batteries inside here are two standard "D" cells,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.22,0:06:05.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,which will power it for approximately 4 and 1/2  to 5 hours.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.84,0:06:08.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,There are, of course, advantages to using off-the-shelf batteries like these
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.32,0:06:10.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,as opposed to having a rechargeable device,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.70,0:06:13.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,especially if you've got your field recorder in the middle of nowhere,

Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.90,0:07:54.08,Chinese,,0,0,0,,It's all down to this very clever motor mechanism, which I can't even begin to explain to you
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.08,0:07:55.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,because I don't quite understand it myself.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.74,0:07:59.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,But it's kind of a direct drive kind of thing. You've got a wheel, you've got another thing
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.00,0:08:03.08,Chinese,,0,0,0,,that's attached to the wheel, which drives it in a certain way that doesn't get affected by
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.08,0:08:05.58,Chinese,,0,0,0,,movement or gravity or things.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.58,0:08:12.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,All very clever, and later on employed in the Sony D6C Professional Walkman as well,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.52,0:08:17.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,but I can't really demonstrate it or show you how it works, so let's just put the cover back on here.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.66,0:08:20.08,Chinese,,0,0,0,,But I will show you around the machine itself.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.28,0:08:22.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,If we start off on the left hand side,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.62,0:08:25.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,we can see we've got a little part that's sticking out of there,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.54,0:08:30.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,and that's to attach a strap to so you can put it over a shoulder. There's one on the other side as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.76,0:08:35.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,At the bottom corner we've got a 6.5 mm stereo headphone jack and above that there's a
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.32,0:08:37.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,control to adjust the volume of that,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.82,0:08:40.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,which also affects the volume of the speaker on the top.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.84,0:08:45.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,It's just a mono speaker really designed just for listening back to what you've recorded to check there's something there.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:45.70,0:08:47.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,It's not a high quality speaker.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.54,0:08:52.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,The keys on this are the typical piano key design, which was popular in the 70's,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.54,0:08:55.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,later on replaced by the kind of touch logic controls.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.38,0:08:59.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,This is basic, but it's basic because it worked and it doesn't go wrong.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.74,0:09:03.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Over on the right hand side, we've got the twin VU meters for the left and right stereo
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.60,0:09:06.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,and a couple of other controls I'll show you a little bit later on.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.18,0:09:09.42,Chinese,,0,0,0,,There's no button to open the cassette door. However,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.42,0:09:13.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,once you've opened it manually, you can see we've got a couple of additional lever switches in here,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.32,0:09:17.46,Chinese,,0,0,0,,one of which turns Dolby B on or off, and the other one selects tape formulations,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.46,0:09:20.20,Chinese,,0,0,0,,between type I and type III.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.40,0:09:25.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,You might remember type III being the shortly-lived formulation, that wasn't on the market all that long.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.58,0:09:30.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,However, this also automatically identifies type II, which is chrome tape,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.18,0:09:34.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,from this little lever at the back. It can play back metal tapes, but it can't record to them.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:34.86,0:09:41.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,If you want to record to metal tapes, then you'll need the TC-D5M, the "M" standing for "metal."
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.70,0:09:44.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,It's a bit unusual that the prosumer model can record to metal,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.62,0:09:47.91,Chinese,,0,0,0,,whereas the professional model can't,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.92,0:09:51.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,and some people say that's perhaps because you need more power to record to metal,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.34,0:09:53.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,so the batteries can last a little bit longer,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:53.54,0:09:57.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,and it doesn't really matter anymore nowadays because it's very hard to find metal tapes,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:57.96,0:10:00.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,and since you can play them back and record to chrome and ferric,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:00.84,0:10:03.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,that's pretty much all you need in a deck nowadays.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.84,0:10:05.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,And then when it comes to playing back tapes,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.16,0:10:11.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,this diminutive little machine puts in an excellent performance whether it's tape type I, II, III, or IV.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.98,0:10:16.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,As long as the original recording was done to a high standard, this thing will reproduce a sound,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.94,0:10:21.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,the kind of which you don't even tend to get out of most home hi-fi decks.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.64,0:10:26.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,And it looks good while it's doing it. I'm a sucker for these bouncing VU needles.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.32,0:10:29.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,I'll also point out that the left hand one is a battery indicator.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.90,0:10:33.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,If you press this button, you can see the needle stays in position to show you
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.62,0:10:36.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,how much battery power you've got left in there.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:36.26,0:10:42.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,And it also turns on a little backlight, although it is quite dim, as you can see here, and it's only on momentarily.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.88,0:10:44.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Once you've used this machine for a while,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:44.44,0:10:48.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,you really start to get an appreciation for some of the finer details.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:48.00,0:10:50.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Little basic things, like this eject button here.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:50.36,0:10:54.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,All it is is a simple lever that's designed to pop the cassette out of the machine,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:54.36,0:10:56.76,Chinese,,0,0,0,,but it's just such a simple little mechanism that works,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:56.76,0:10:59.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,why bother doing anything different?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.76,0:11:03.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Now, of course, if you're playing back any music through this, you don't want to be doing it
Dialogue: 0,0:11:03.72,0:11:08.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,through that built-in speaker, because it's just a tinny little speaker that's designed so that you can tell
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.80,0:11:10.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,that there's something on the tape.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:10.50,0:11:13.40,Chinese,,0,0,0,,You really want to plug it into some sort of external amplifier
Dialogue: 0,0:11:13.40,0:11:18.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,or you could just plug those RCA plugs into external powered speakers like I've got here,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:18.60,0:11:20.28,Chinese,,0,0,0,,and it makes a heck of a difference.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:27.08,0:11:30.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,One reason I used this machine when I was demonstrating the Atari Video Music the other week
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.02,0:11:34.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,is because you can have two live audio outputs at the same time,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:34.60,0:11:39.28,Chinese,,0,0,0,,so I could plug the RCA outputs into the Atari and the headphone output came out of the front
Dialogue: 0,0:11:39.28,0:11:42.20,Chinese,,0,0,0,,and into the camera that I was recording everything with.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:42.26,0:11:45.48,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Talking of recording, you've got a record level dial here,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:45.48,0:11:47.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,made out of metal. It's sort of gunmetal, in a way.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:47.90,0:11:51.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,The whole thing feels a little bit military at times. It's just so well put together.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:51.78,0:11:54.29,Chinese,,0,0,0,,But, as you can see, you can adjust the left and right separately,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:54.30,0:11:57.46,Chinese,,0,0,0,,and of course, during interviews, they might have had one microphone for one person,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:57.46,0:11:59.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,one for the other and you could have adjusted the levels;
Dialogue: 0,0:12:00.06,0:12:01.92,Chinese,,0,0,0,,however, if you want to plug something into this,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:01.92,0:12:08.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,you can get a lead which will convert RCA into microphone balanced XLR inputs;
Dialogue: 0,0:12:08.72,0:12:11.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,however, once you plug those into an output,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:11.98,0:12:17.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,say, from a line out from a CD player, like I'm doing here, and then plug the other end into the D5,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:17.86,0:12:23.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,you find that line level outputs are a lot "hotter," a lot louder than microphone level
Dialogue: 0,0:12:23.98,0:12:27.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,so that, if I put pause on here and pressed record,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:27.00,0:12:29.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,you can see that it's just peaking the whole thing out completely.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:29.68,0:12:33.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,We've got the peak light shining at the top there as well, next to the record light.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:33.32,0:12:37.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,You can see, if I just turn it up slightly, it's just straight into the peaks.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:37.18,0:12:43.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,So, the line level output needs to be brought down to the level of a mic level input.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:43.54,0:12:46.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Fortunately, they've got this switch on the side here which takes 20 decibels off it,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:46.84,0:12:52.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,so if we do that, we can bring it down to a level the device is supposed to record at.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:52.86,0:12:56.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Now, I'm not sure whether I'm supposed to be doing it this way, but it does seem to work fine
Dialogue: 0,0:12:56.74,0:13:00.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,so I'm just going to carry on. But yeah. You've also got a limiter at the bottom right.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:00.54,0:13:03.64,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Notice if I turn this all the way up, we have it so it's peaking out,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:03.64,0:13:08.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,turn the limiter on, and it will try and keep it back within normal recording level parameters.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:08.58,0:13:10.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,That's for if you're at some sort of loud concert,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:10.80,0:13:13.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,or somewhere where there's gonna be loud noises every now and then.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:13.54,0:13:17.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,You want it just to limit those so doesn't oversaturate the recording.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:18.30,0:13:20.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,You might have noticed that my machine is in really good condition.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:20.90,0:13:24.94,Chinese,,0,0,0,,In fact, the only marks on it are these little two scratches on the top here in the black paint.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:24.94,0:13:27.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,But that's it. And the reason that it's in such good condition
Dialogue: 0,0:13:27.92,0:13:30.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,is because it was kept in its protective case.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:30.34,0:13:32.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,That's one of the great things about field recorders.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:32.52,0:13:36.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,They all came with one of these protective cases, so as long as the person who owned it before you
Dialogue: 0,0:13:36.88,0:13:39.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,kept it in there, there's a good chance that it won't have got these scratches and marks
Dialogue: 0,0:13:39.86,0:13:43.28,Chinese,,0,0,0,,that something of this age would usually have by now.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:43.58,0:13:45.58,Chinese,,0,0,0,,As you can see, once you put it inside the case,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:45.58,0:13:48.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,the original strap connectors go through holes in there,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:48.70,0:13:51.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,and then your strap is supposed to attach to the connectors on the case itself.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:52.34,0:13:57.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,My case has got a few scratches and nicks in it. The leather's started to peel away in places,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:57.34,0:13:59.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,but it's done its job. It's protected the machine.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:59.56,0:14:04.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,In fact, you can even replace the cassettes inside the deck without taking it out of the case.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:04.16,0:14:08.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,The only thing you'll need to take it out for, really, is to replace the batteries.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:08.52,0:14:13.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Now while Sony might have had the D5 on the market longer than any other rival model,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:13.66,0:14:19.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,there were quite a few other machines that came and went during its lifetime, from a number of different manufacturers.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:19.44,0:14:23.10,Chinese,,0,0,0,,One of the more respected of those was Marantz, and this model here
Dialogue: 0,0:14:23.30,0:14:27.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,does bear quite a striking resemblance  to the D5 in places.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:27.44,0:14:31.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,The model is the CP430, that's the European model number,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:32.04,0:14:34.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,in the US it was known as the PMD430.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:34.84,0:14:38.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,It does Dolby B, but it also does dbx.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:39.04,0:14:42.46,Chinese,,0,0,0,,This is the only dbx machine I've got, I only picked this up a couple of weeks ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:42.46,0:14:45.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,It's quite high end. It does chrome and metal recording as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:45.88,0:14:50.03,Chinese,,0,0,0,,You can see down at the bottom here we've got a pitch and a bias control on there,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:50.04,0:14:52.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,and it's also a 3 head machine.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:52.80,0:14:57.08,Chinese,,0,0,0,,So that means I can listen back to the recordings that it's making as it's making them.

Dialogue: 0,0:15:26.84,0:15:29.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Something else I'd learned while doing  a bit of research for this video:
Dialogue: 0,0:15:32.48,0:15:34.39,Chinese,,0,0,0,,You know, earlier on I mentioned the BBC used these Uher 4400 recorders.

Dialogue: 0,0:15:47.40,0:15:49.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Which is classed as a professional Walkman,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:49.98,0:15:53.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,but really it's a very sophisticated little portable recorder,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:53.04,0:16:00.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,able to record using Dolby C and record onto metal-- both things that I can't do with my D5.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:10.96,0:16:13.02,Chinese,,0,0,0,,I think it's time to do the wrap-up.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:14.62,0:16:20.43,Chinese,,0,0,0,,There are still plenty of people out there that, for one reason or another, need a decent quality cassette deck.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:36.78,0:16:40.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Pretend it's like a concept car at a motor show. You can't buy it,

Dialogue: 0,0:16:54.34,0:16:56.58,Chinese,,0,0,0,,That costs $400 over there,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:56.58,0:17:02.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,and it doesn't have any kind of Dolby noise reduction circuitry and I'd imagine that's perhaps down to some sort of licensing issues.
