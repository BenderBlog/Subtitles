Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.96,0:00:11.32,English,,0,0,0,,If you assembled a group of people and asked them to describe a "portable cassette player,"
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.32,0:00:15.36,English,,0,0,0,,it's more than likely they'd tell you about a Walkman or a boombox.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.58,0:00:19.78,English,,0,0,0,,However, if you asked the same group to describe a "high end cassette recorder,"
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.16,0:00:22.88,English,,0,0,0,,they'd probably tell you about a hi-fi component.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.12,0:00:26.82,English,,0,0,0,,However, there is one type of cassette recorder that's both those things.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.84,0:00:30.12,English,,0,0,0,,It's high end and it's portable, and, no surprise,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.12,0:00:32.44,English,,0,0,0,,I've got one here today to show you,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.44,0:00:35.44,English,,0,0,0,,this is the Sony TC-D5.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.48,0:00:36.66,English,,0,0,0,,Let's take a look at it.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.12,0:00:49.46,English,,0,0,0,,Now, the Sony TC-D5 isn't just one cassette model, it's a total of four.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.46,0:00:53.72,English,,0,0,0,,The version I've got here is the Pro II. This is the last revision.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.82,0:00:59.22,English,,0,0,0,,However, the original one that came out in 1978 was just called the TC-D5.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.54,0:01:06.32,English,,0,0,0,,That was revised in 1980 to the TC-D5M, which meant it could record onto metal tapes.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.46,0:01:09.96,English,,0,0,0,,That one carried on being sold until 2005 approximately,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.10,0:01:16.46,English,,0,0,0,,but it forked in 1982. There was a Pro model issued which had XLR microphone inputs,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.46,0:01:22.88,English,,0,0,0,,and that was revised in 1986 and carried on to some time around about 1999, or maybe a little bit beyond there.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.88,0:01:25.14,English,,0,0,0,,So putting aside the more technical differences for the moment,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.14,0:01:28.76,English,,0,0,0,,things like different record heads and microphone amplification circuitry, things like that,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.96,0:01:32.54,English,,0,0,0,,your average chap industry is more interested in the fact that your
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.80,0:01:36.74,English,,0,0,0,,"Pro" and "Pro II" only have XLR mic level inputs,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.74,0:01:43.48,English,,0,0,0,,whereas the "prosumer" versions, the original and the M, have line level RCA inputs.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.68,0:01:45.18,English,,0,0,0,,And, outputs of course.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.34,0:01:48.68,English,,0,0,0,,Let's just take a step back for the moment and talk about field recorders in general
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.68,0:01:50.26,English,,0,0,0,,because they are still in use.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.54,0:01:52.78,English,,0,0,0,,Of course, nowadays people tend to use digital ones,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.88,0:01:55.72,English,,0,0,0,,some of these microphones will be for radio stations,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.72,0:01:58.58,English,,0,0,0,,they don't need to record video, so they just record onto a digital recorder.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.58,0:02:01.62,English,,0,0,0,,And the same would have gone for back in the eighties.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.68,0:02:04.70,English,,0,0,0,,People would have been using cassette recorders for that purpose.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.80,0:02:09.16,English,,0,0,0,,It was perfectly acceptable to use them for radio broadcasts. The quality was good enough for that.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.64,0:02:13.90,English,,0,0,0,,Of course, before then, people used reel-to-reel recorders and field recorders have existed
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.90,0:02:16.70,English,,0,0,0,,pretty much as long as recording itself has.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.88,0:02:22.82,English,,0,0,0,,Of course, back in the sixties and seventies, when the TV news quite often relied on 16 mm film,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.86,0:02:26.72,English,,0,0,0,,you'd have a separate sound chap recording the audio separate to the camera.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.92,0:02:32.04,English,,0,0,0,,But of course, later on, we started synchronizing the video and the sound onto one device,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.06,0:02:35.26,English,,0,0,0,,so field recorders tended to be used more just for radio.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.26,0:02:37.74,English,,0,0,0,,It wasn't that long ago that I was interviewed in the street like this.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.74,0:02:41.22,English,,0,0,0,,...I mean, not dressed up like a woman, like the comedian Dick Emery,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.42,0:02:44.64,English,,0,0,0,,but no, with a reporter coming up to me with a microphone in one hand,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.64,0:02:46.78,English,,0,0,0,,cassette recorder slung over their shoulder.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.94,0:02:49.46,English,,0,0,0,,That was for something on local radio news.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.62,0:02:53.50,English,,0,0,0,,At the time the D5 came out, many of the rivals were only capable of recording in mono.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.70,0:02:56.74,English,,0,0,0,,The D5 was capable of good quality stereo recording,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.76,0:03:01.12,English,,0,0,0,,and therefore often put to good use in the tapers' section at a Grateful Dead concert.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.12,0:03:05.58,English,,0,0,0,,And another early adopter of the D5 was Sony co-founder Masaru Ibuka,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.60,0:03:08.36,English,,0,0,0,,who took one along with him on his business trips
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.36,0:03:11.50,English,,0,0,0,,with a set of headphones to listen to classical music.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.50,0:03:14.20,English,,0,0,0,,It had a good, long battery life but it was a little bit bulky,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.20,0:03:19.32,English,,0,0,0,,and he mentioned this in early 1979 to Akio Morita, who was the chairman,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.32,0:03:22.82,English,,0,0,0,,and that resulted in Sony developing their first Walkman.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.88,0:03:25.84,English,,0,0,0,,So just think, if the D5 hadn't existed,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.84,0:03:28.68,English,,0,0,0,,perhaps the Walkman would never have happened.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.04,0:03:33.34,English,,0,0,0,,Sony called the TC-D5 the "ultimate portable cassette deck,"
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.52,0:03:38.12,English,,0,0,0,,and kept using that tagline throughout its life, and it was a long life as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.32,0:03:45.18,English,,0,0,0,,Looking back through the old Sony catalogs, you can see the D5 there in the 1980's and the 1990's.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.26,0:03:49.06,English,,0,0,0,,All the other products in the catalog completely changed during that time,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.14,0:03:52.18,English,,0,0,0,,whereas the D5 remains constant throughout.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.18,0:03:54.94,English,,0,0,0,,If it was a car, it would be like the Land Rover.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.94,0:03:58.14,English,,0,0,0,,It looked very similar to the models that came out decades before,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.14,0:04:01.56,English,,0,0,0,,but there was no need to change it because they got it right first time.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.56,0:04:04.22,English,,0,0,0,,And the same could be said for the D5.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.76,0:04:07.90,English,,0,0,0,,But when it comes to the, normally, fast-moving world of consumer electronics,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.90,0:04:10.22,English,,0,0,0,,the D5 is a bit of an anomaly.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.42,0:04:17.00,English,,0,0,0,,When it was first launched in 1978 when the BBC were using reel-to-reel recorders for their field work,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.10,0:04:22.58,English,,0,0,0,,and then it existed throughout the years of the Walkman and the small dictaphones
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.78,0:04:24.68,English,,0,0,0,,and carried on throughout,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.68,0:04:27.38,English,,0,0,0,,all the way through into the 21st century.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.38,0:04:29.92,English,,0,0,0,,I've even found it mentioned in this B&H catalog
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.92,0:04:33.02,English,,0,0,0,,where you can find professional MiniDisc recorders,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.02,0:04:37.74,English,,0,0,0,,DAT recorders, CD-Rs, hard drives; but alongside all those,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.74,0:04:40.92,English,,0,0,0,,it's still there, the D5 Pro II.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.02,0:04:45.90,English,,0,0,0,,Now, the reason I chose the Pro II over the other models in the range is because it was the last revision.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.90,0:04:48.78,English,,0,0,0,,It actually came out in 1986.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.78,0:04:52.48,English,,0,0,0,,The D5M was last revised in 1980.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.76,0:04:58.70,English,,0,0,0,,The Pro II has a couple of improvements, such as the recording circuitry, better quality heads,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.70,0:05:01.98,English,,0,0,0,,a shield over the heads to stop interference from buzzing, things like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.24,0:05:06.90,English,,0,0,0,,But the Pro models were only generally available through specialist outlets like B&H.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.00,0:05:09.60,English,,0,0,0,,If you go on the Sony website, they still do "pro" products,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.60,0:05:14.04,English,,0,0,0,,you've got to go past the normal "consumer" stuff, down to the bottom here you can see the pro range,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.04,0:05:17.22,English,,0,0,0,,and the stuff there is really for broadcasters.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.22,0:05:20.82,English,,0,0,0,,And if you have a look at some of the prices on this, you can see why they classed it as pro.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.04,0:05:24.82,English,,0,0,0,,For example, this point-of-view camera is $75,000.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.82,0:05:30.64,English,,0,0,0,,So yeah, you can see this "pro" cassette recorder is designed for that market, and it feels quality as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.70,0:05:33.80,English,,0,0,0,,The whole thing is made out of metal. There's a couple of bits of plastic here and there,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.80,0:05:38.14,English,,0,0,0,,but really, the whole body and the structure of the thing is just solid.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.34,0:05:41.44,English,,0,0,0,,It's designed to take a kick and keep on recording.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.70,0:05:44.76,English,,0,0,0,,Along the bottom here, you can see this section is made out of a rubber,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.76,0:05:48.24,English,,0,0,0,,and that's a kind of protective bumper because when you hold it on your side,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.24,0:05:51.08,English,,0,0,0,,if you were to drop it, that's the part it would land on.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.28,0:05:54.40,English,,0,0,0,,Even the battery compartment has a metal cover.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.44,0:05:57.42,English,,0,0,0,,Might not sound like a big deal, but very rare to see that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.42,0:06:01.22,English,,0,0,0,,The batteries inside here are two standard "D" cells,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.22,0:06:05.52,English,,0,0,0,,which will power it for approximately 4 and 1/2 to 5 hours.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.84,0:06:08.32,English,,0,0,0,,There are, of course, advantages to using off-the-shelf batteries like these
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.32,0:06:10.70,English,,0,0,0,,as opposed to having a rechargeable device,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.70,0:06:13.54,English,,0,0,0,,especially if you've got your field recorder in the middle of nowhere,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.54,0:06:15.88,English,,0,0,0,,somewhere where there's no power. How would you recharge anything?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.08,0:06:18.74,English,,0,0,0,,You could always carry along a few extra batteries with you, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.24,0:06:23.10,English,,0,0,0,,And also I noticed in this article it was about recording audio for the radio.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.10,0:06:27.16,English,,0,0,0,,They mentioned that after the tsunami, the only machine that was still working was the D5
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.24,0:06:30.90,English,,0,0,0,,when their more modern MiniDisc and DAT machines had already given up.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.46,0:06:36.90,English,,0,0,0,,I should also mention that both my Pro II model and the D5M can be run off DC power.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.90,0:06:39.78,English,,0,0,0,,However, I don't think the same goes for the original Pro.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.78,0:06:44.50,English,,0,0,0,,Where mine's got a DC power jack, that's got a stereo and mono switch.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.88,0:06:46.66,English,,0,0,0,,Right, so I want to show you something now.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.66,0:06:50.22,English,,0,0,0,,I've taken the Pro II outside, I've got something recorded on this cassette.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.22,0:06:54.74,English,,0,0,0,,I'm going to play it into the camera and, just have a listen to this for a moment.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.04,0:07:00.00,English,,0,0,0,,[Playback]: "If you want to develop a professional field recorder,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.00,0:07:02.75,English,,0,0,0,,you can't just take a typical cassette mechanism
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.75,0:07:05.38,English,,0,0,0,,and plonk it into a case along with some batteries.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.38,0:07:07.48,English,,0,0,0,,No, because as soon as you were to move it,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.48,0:07:09.32,English,,0,0,0,,the sound would become wobbly.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.38,0:07:11.60,English,,0,0,0,,This is due to variations in the tape speed.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.60,0:07:15.12,English,,0,0,0,,It's something more commonly referred to as "wow" and "flutter."
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.12,0:07:19.64,English,,0,0,0,,Shaking the D5 though has no effect. The playback speed is unaltered,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.84,0:07:23.46,English,,0,0,0,,and this is thanks to a new type of drive mechanism that Sony developed
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.46,0:07:24.98,English,,0,0,0,,just for this machine.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.98,0:07:29.50,English,,0,0,0,,This kind of performance was vital for a device that has to record broadcast-quality audio
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.50,0:07:32.06,English,,0,0,0,,whether it's at a press conference sat on a table,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.06,0:07:36.96,English,,0,0,0,,or slung over the shoulder of a reporter running through a war zone.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.64,0:07:40.84,English,,0,0,0,,Now that really was quite impressive!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.84,0:07:43.98,English,,0,0,0,,Of course nowadays though, when people are listening to solid state devices
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.98,0:07:46.94,English,,0,0,0,,with no moving parts, it doesn't quite have the same impact.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.06,0:07:49.90,English,,0,0,0,,But when this thing came out, that was a bit of a revelation.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.90,0:07:54.08,English,,0,0,0,,It's all down to this very clever motor mechanism, which I can't even begin to explain to you
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.08,0:07:55.74,English,,0,0,0,,because I don't quite understand it myself.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.74,0:07:59.00,English,,0,0,0,,But it's kind of a direct drive kind of thing. You've got a wheel, you've got another thing
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.00,0:08:03.08,English,,0,0,0,,that's attached to the wheel, which drives it in a certain way that doesn't get affected by
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.08,0:08:05.58,English,,0,0,0,,movement or gravity or things.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.58,0:08:12.52,English,,0,0,0,,All very clever, and later on employed in the Sony D6C Professional Walkman as well,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.52,0:08:17.66,English,,0,0,0,,but I can't really demonstrate it or show you how it works, so let's just put the cover back on here.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.66,0:08:20.08,English,,0,0,0,,But I will show you around the machine itself.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.28,0:08:22.62,English,,0,0,0,,If we start off on the left hand side,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.62,0:08:25.54,English,,0,0,0,,we can see we've got a little part that's sticking out of there,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.54,0:08:30.34,English,,0,0,0,,and that's to attach a strap to so you can put it over a shoulder. There's one on the other side as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.76,0:08:35.32,English,,0,0,0,,At the bottom corner we've got a 6.5 mm stereo headphone jack and above that there's a

Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.82,0:08:40.84,English,,0,0,0,,which also affects the volume of the speaker on the top.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.84,0:08:45.70,English,,0,0,0,,It's just a mono speaker really designed just for listening back to what you've recorded\N to check there's something there.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:45.70,0:08:47.34,English,,0,0,0,,It's not a high quality speaker.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.54,0:08:52.54,English,,0,0,0,,The keys on this are the typical piano key design, which was popular in the 70's,

Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.38,0:08:59.66,English,,0,0,0,,This is basic, but it's basic because it worked and it doesn't go wrong.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.74,0:09:03.60,English,,0,0,0,,Over on the right hand side, we've got the twin VU meters for the left and right stereo
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.60,0:09:06.86,English,,0,0,0,,and a couple of other controls I'll show you a little bit later on.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.18,0:09:09.42,English,,0,0,0,,There's no button to open the cassette door. However,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.42,0:09:13.32,English,,0,0,0,,once you've opened it manually, you can see we've got a couple of additional lever switches in here,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.32,0:09:17.46,English,,0,0,0,,one of which turns Dolby B on or off, and the other one selects tape formulations,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.46,0:09:20.20,English,,0,0,0,,between type I and type III.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.40,0:09:25.38,English,,0,0,0,,You might remember type III being the shortly-lived formulation, that wasn't on the market all that long.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.58,0:09:30.04,English,,0,0,0,,However, this also automatically identifies type II, which is chrome tape,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.18,0:09:34.86,English,,0,0,0,,from this little lever at the back. It can play back metal tapes, but it can't record to them.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:34.86,0:09:41.32,English,,0,0,0,,If you want to record to metal tapes, then you'll need the TC-D5M, the "M" standing for "metal."
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.70,0:09:44.62,English,,0,0,0,,It's a bit unusual that the prosumer model can record to metal,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.62,0:09:47.91,English,,0,0,0,,whereas the professional model can't,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.92,0:09:51.34,English,,0,0,0,,and some people say that's perhaps because you need more power to record to metal,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.34,0:09:53.34,English,,0,0,0,,so the batteries can last a little bit longer,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:53.54,0:09:57.96,English,,0,0,0,,and it doesn't really matter anymore nowadays because it's very hard to find metal tapes,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:57.96,0:10:00.84,English,,0,0,0,,and since you can play them back and record to chrome and ferric,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:00.84,0:10:03.84,English,,0,0,0,,that's pretty much all you need in a deck nowadays.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.84,0:10:05.96,English,,0,0,0,,And then when it comes to playing back tapes,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.16,0:10:11.98,English,,0,0,0,,this diminutive little machine puts in an excellent performance whether it's tape type I, II, III, or IV.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.98,0:10:16.86,English,,0,0,0,,As long as the original recording was done to a high standard, this thing will reproduce a sound,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.94,0:10:21.44,English,,0,0,0,,the kind of which you don't even tend to get out of most home hi-fi decks.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.64,0:10:26.22,English,,0,0,0,,And it looks good while it's doing it. I'm a sucker for these bouncing VU needles.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.32,0:10:29.70,English,,0,0,0,,I'll also point out that the left hand one is a battery indicator.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.90,0:10:33.62,English,,0,0,0,,If you press this button, you can see the needle stays in position to show you
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.62,0:10:36.26,English,,0,0,0,,how much battery power you've got left in there.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:36.26,0:10:42.34,English,,0,0,0,,And it also turns on a little backlight, although it is quite dim, as you can see here, and it's only on momentarily.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.88,0:10:44.44,English,,0,0,0,,Once you've used this machine for a while,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:44.44,0:10:48.00,English,,0,0,0,,you really start to get an appreciation for some of the finer details.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:48.00,0:10:50.36,English,,0,0,0,,Little basic things, like this eject button here.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:50.36,0:10:54.36,English,,0,0,0,,All it is is a simple lever that's designed to pop the cassette out of the machine,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:54.36,0:10:56.76,English,,0,0,0,,but it's just such a simple little mechanism that works,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:56.76,0:10:59.70,English,,0,0,0,,why bother doing anything different?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.76,0:11:03.72,English,,0,0,0,,Now, of course, if you're playing back any music through this, you don't want to be doing it
Dialogue: 0,0:11:03.72,0:11:08.60,English,,0,0,0,,through that built-in speaker, because it's just a tinny little speaker that's designed so that you can tell
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.80,0:11:10.14,English,,0,0,0,,that there's something on the tape.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:10.50,0:11:13.40,English,,0,0,0,,You really want to plug it into some sort of external amplifier
Dialogue: 0,0:11:13.40,0:11:18.60,English,,0,0,0,,or you could just plug those RCA plugs into external powered speakers like I've got here,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:18.60,0:11:20.28,English,,0,0,0,,and it makes a heck of a difference.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:27.08,0:11:30.82,English,,0,0,0,,One reason I used this machine when I was demonstrating the Atari Video Music the other week
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.02,0:11:34.60,English,,0,0,0,,is because you can have two live audio outputs at the same time,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:34.60,0:11:39.28,English,,0,0,0,,so I could plug the RCA outputs into the Atari and the headphone output came out of the front
Dialogue: 0,0:11:39.28,0:11:42.20,English,,0,0,0,,and into the camera that I was recording everything with.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:42.26,0:11:45.48,English,,0,0,0,,Talking of recording, you've got a record level dial here,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:45.48,0:11:47.90,English,,0,0,0,,made out of metal. It's sort of gunmetal, in a way.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:47.90,0:11:51.78,English,,0,0,0,,The whole thing feels a little bit military at times. It's just so well put together.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:51.78,0:11:54.29,English,,0,0,0,,But, as you can see, you can adjust the left and right separately,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:54.30,0:11:57.46,English,,0,0,0,,and of course, during interviews, they might have had one microphone for one person,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:57.46,0:11:59.86,English,,0,0,0,,one for the other and you could have adjusted the levels;
Dialogue: 0,0:12:00.06,0:12:01.92,English,,0,0,0,,however, if you want to plug something into this,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:01.92,0:12:08.72,English,,0,0,0,,you can get a lead which will convert RCA into microphone balanced XLR inputs;
Dialogue: 0,0:12:08.72,0:12:11.86,English,,0,0,0,,however, once you plug those into an output,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:11.98,0:12:17.86,English,,0,0,0,,say, from a line out from a CD player, like I'm doing here, and then plug the other end into the D5,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:17.86,0:12:23.98,English,,0,0,0,,you find that line level outputs are a lot "hotter," a lot louder than microphone level
Dialogue: 0,0:12:23.98,0:12:27.00,English,,0,0,0,,so that, if I put pause on here and pressed record,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:27.00,0:12:29.68,English,,0,0,0,,you can see that it's just peaking the whole thing out completely.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:29.68,0:12:33.32,English,,0,0,0,,We've got the peak light shining at the top there as well, next to the record light.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:33.32,0:12:37.04,English,,0,0,0,,You can see, if I just turn it up slightly, it's just straight into the peaks.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:37.18,0:12:43.26,English,,0,0,0,,So, the line level output needs to be brought down to the level of a mic level input.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:43.54,0:12:46.78,English,,0,0,0,,Fortunately, they've got this switch on the side here which takes 20 decibels off it,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:46.84,0:12:52.86,English,,0,0,0,,so if we do that, we can bring it down to a level the device is supposed to record at.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:52.86,0:12:56.74,English,,0,0,0,,Now, I'm not sure whether I'm supposed to be doing it this way, but it does seem to work fine
Dialogue: 0,0:12:56.74,0:13:00.54,English,,0,0,0,,so I'm just going to carry on. But yeah. You've also got a limiter at the bottom right.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:00.54,0:13:03.64,English,,0,0,0,,Notice if I turn this all the way up, we have it so it's peaking out,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:03.64,0:13:08.44,English,,0,0,0,,turn the limiter on, and it will try and keep it back within normal recording level parameters.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:08.58,0:13:10.60,English,,0,0,0,,That's for if you're at some sort of loud concert,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:10.80,0:13:13.54,English,,0,0,0,,or somewhere where there's gonna be loud noises every now and then.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:13.54,0:13:17.34,English,,0,0,0,,You want it just to limit those so doesn't oversaturate the recording.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:18.30,0:13:20.90,English,,0,0,0,,You might have noticed that my machine is in really good condition.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:20.90,0:13:24.94,English,,0,0,0,,In fact, the only marks on it are these little two scratches on the top here in the black paint.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:24.94,0:13:27.72,English,,0,0,0,,But that's it. And the reason that it's in such good condition
Dialogue: 0,0:13:27.92,0:13:30.34,English,,0,0,0,,is because it was kept in its protective case.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:30.34,0:13:32.52,English,,0,0,0,,That's one of the great things about field recorders.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:32.52,0:13:36.88,English,,0,0,0,,They all came with one of these protective cases, so as long as the person who owned it before you
Dialogue: 0,0:13:36.88,0:13:39.80,English,,0,0,0,,kept it in there, there's a good chance that it won't have got these scratches and marks
Dialogue: 0,0:13:39.86,0:13:43.28,English,,0,0,0,,that something of this age would usually have by now.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:43.58,0:13:45.58,English,,0,0,0,,As you can see, once you put it inside the case,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:45.58,0:13:48.70,English,,0,0,0,,the original strap connectors go through holes in there,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:48.70,0:13:51.98,English,,0,0,0,,and then your strap is supposed to attach to the connectors on the case itself.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:52.34,0:13:57.34,English,,0,0,0,,My case has got a few scratches and nicks in it. The leather's started to peel away in places,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:57.34,0:13:59.36,English,,0,0,0,,but it's done its job. It's protected the machine.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:59.56,0:14:04.12,English,,0,0,0,,In fact, you can even replace the cassettes inside the deck without taking it out of the case.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:04.16,0:14:08.04,English,,0,0,0,,The only thing you'll need to take it out for, really, is to replace the batteries.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:08.52,0:14:13.66,English,,0,0,0,,Now while Sony might have had the D5 on the market longer than any other rival model,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:13.66,0:14:19.44,English,,0,0,0,,there were quite a few other machines that came and went during its lifetime, from a number of different manufacturers.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:19.44,0:14:23.10,English,,0,0,0,,One of the more respected of those was Marantz, and this model here
Dialogue: 0,0:14:23.30,0:14:27.44,English,,0,0,0,,does bear quite a striking resemblance to the D5 in places.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:27.44,0:14:31.84,English,,0,0,0,,The model is the CP430, that's the European model number,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:32.04,0:14:34.84,English,,0,0,0,,in the US it was known as the PMD430.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:34.84,0:14:38.84,English,,0,0,0,,It does Dolby B, but it also does dbx.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:39.04,0:14:42.46,English,,0,0,0,,This is the only dbx machine I've got, I only picked this up a couple of weeks ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:42.46,0:14:45.88,English,,0,0,0,,It's quite high end. It does chrome and metal recording as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:45.88,0:14:50.03,English,,0,0,0,,You can see down at the bottom here we've got a pitch and a bias control on there,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:50.04,0:14:52.80,English,,0,0,0,,and it's also a 3 head machine.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:52.80,0:14:57.08,English,,0,0,0,,So that means I can listen back to the recordings that it's making as it's making them.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:57.12,0:15:00.25,English,,0,0,0,,And you just press that button down there to listen to either the tape
Dialogue: 0,0:15:00.25,0:15:02.36,English,,0,0,0,,or the source.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:02.36,0:15:06.52,English,,0,0,0,,So when it comes to features, it appears that this device has the Sony beaten hands-down.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:06.52,0:15:10.72,English,,0,0,0,,However, when it comes to build quality, the Sony is clearly the victor.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:10.96,0:15:13.10,English,,0,0,0,,Where the Sony's got a solid metal construction,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:13.30,0:15:16.22,English,,0,0,0,,this has a flimsy, creaky plastic one.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:16.42,0:15:18.12,English,,0,0,0,,The Sony feels like a metal brick,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:18.12,0:15:20.24,English,,0,0,0,,this feels like an empty plastic box.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:20.24,0:15:23.84,English,,0,0,0,,And after reading up a little bit online, it seems like the wow and flutter numbers
Dialogue: 0,0:15:24.00,0:15:26.60,English,,0,0,0,,aren't that impressive for this machine, either.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:26.84,0:15:29.74,English,,0,0,0,,Something else I'd learned while doing a bit of research for this video:
Dialogue: 0,0:15:32.48,0:15:34.39,English,,0,0,0,,You know, earlier on I mentioned the BBC used these Uher 4400 recorders.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:34.40,0:15:39.60,English,,0,0,0,,I've even seen those for sale on eBay saying "ex-BBC" and they've got all the stamps and things on them.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:39.60,0:15:42.60,English,,0,0,0,,Well, when they replaced those, they didn't use the D5.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:42.78,0:15:47.34,English,,0,0,0,,No, instead, they used its smaller newer brother the Sony D6C.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:47.40,0:15:49.98,English,,0,0,0,,Which is classed as a professional Walkman,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:49.98,0:15:53.04,English,,0,0,0,,but really it's a very sophisticated little portable recorder,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:53.04,0:16:00.66,English,,0,0,0,,able to record using Dolby C and record onto metal-- both things that I can't do with my D5.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:01.18,0:16:04.36,English,,0,0,0,,But I will talk more about the D6C in a future video.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:04.36,0:16:07.22,English,,0,0,0,,I plan on doing a video where I talk about the Walkman,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:07.22,0:16:10.96,English,,0,0,0,,and I'll feature it in that one, but getting back to the D5.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:10.96,0:16:13.02,English,,0,0,0,,I think it's time to do the wrap-up.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:14.62,0:16:20.43,English,,0,0,0,,There are still plenty of people out there that, for one reason or another, need a decent quality cassette deck.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:20.47,0:16:24.36,English,,0,0,0,,But if you go looking to buy a new one, nowadays, there's very little choice.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:24.36,0:16:28.48,English,,0,0,0,,You've got your cheap, plasticky novelties, the things that convert tapes to MP3s,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:28.68,0:16:33.72,English,,0,0,0,,and one of the things that people have asked me to review a lot is the elbow cassette player,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:33.72,0:16:36.78,English,,0,0,0,,but that's just a design concept at the moment.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:36.78,0:16:40.68,English,,0,0,0,,Pretend it's like a concept car at a motor show. You can't buy it,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:40.78,0:16:44.22,English,,0,0,0,,and whether or not anything like that will ever come to the market in the future?
Dialogue: 0,0:16:44.22,0:16:45.94,English,,0,0,0,,We'll just have to wait and see on that one.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:45.94,0:16:49.86,English,,0,0,0,,As far as things you can go in a real shop somewhere in the world and buy?
Dialogue: 0,0:16:49.86,0:16:54.34,English,,0,0,0,,Well, in the US, you can go get the Tascam CD-A580.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:54.34,0:16:56.58,English,,0,0,0,,That costs $400 over there,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:56.58,0:16:59.34,English,,0,0,0,,and it doesn't have any kind of Dolby noise reduction circuitry
Dialogue: 0,0:16:59.34,0:17:02.38,English,,0,0,0,,I'd imagine that's perhaps down to some sort of licensing issues.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:02.38,0:17:04.96,English,,0,0,0,,My preference, though, would be to go for something older.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:04.96,0:17:09.52,English,,0,0,0,,But even if you go back to 1990, you're still talking 27 years old,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:09.61,0:17:16.20,English,,0,0,0,,so you got to buy something that was top-quality back in the day if it's going to be working perfectly nowadays,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:16.20,0:17:19.74,English,,0,0,0,,and you won't get much better quality than one of these things.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:20.29,0:17:24.34,English,,0,0,0,,Now they quite often get overlooked when it comes to second-hand tape players
Dialogue: 0,0:17:24.34,0:17:26.00,English,,0,0,0,,because they don't look particularly impressive.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:26.00,0:17:29.56,English,,0,0,0,,Once they're in the case it could be some sort of dictation machine or something.

Dialogue: 0,0:19:47.84,0:19:50.74,English,,0,0,0,,and streaming music is better than listening to a tape!

Dialogue: 0,0:19:54.50,0:19:56.96,English,,0,0,0,,explaining how great streaming music is?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:57.34,0:19:59.20,English,,0,0,0,,That's not a bad idea!

Dialogue: 0,0:20:48.64,0:20:52.88,English,,0,0,0,,just like every tape does, every time you play it.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:53.20,0:20:55.24,English,,0,0,0,,Boo! This is rubbish!

Dialogue: 0,0:21:04.10,0:21:08.38,English,,0,0,0,,you'll be doing what everyone else does, so you'll be normal.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:08.38,0:21:12.02,English,,0,0,0,,And you won't have to store all those records and tapes and things.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:12.46,0:21:18.94,English,,0,0,0,,So what if I already use streaming music, but I also collect records and tapes?
Dialogue: 0,0:21:19.40,0:21:24.06,English,,0,0,0,,Uh...you need to stop doing what you enjoy, and do what I want you to do.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.96,0:00:11.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,如果你问很多人便携式磁带播放器是啥的话
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.32,0:00:15.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他们大多会说出索尼大法的随身听或者是八九十年代流行的手提音响
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.58,0:00:19.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然而，如果你问他们高级磁带录音机是什么的话
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.16,0:00:22.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他们大多会跟你讲很多的Hifi设备
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.12,0:00:26.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然而，有一种磁带录音机是两者兼备的
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.84,0:00:30.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,又高端又很便捷，当然啦
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.12,0:00:32.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我搞来了一个，现在给大家展示的是
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.44,0:00:35.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,索尼的 TC-D5
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.48,0:00:36.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,咱们来仔细看看
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.12,0:00:49.46,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，索尼的TC-D5不只是只有这一个型号，实际上有四个
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.46,0:00:53.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我搞来的是Pro II，这个系列的最新型号
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.82,0:00:59.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然而，初版机器是在1978年问世的，当时叫做TC-D5
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.54,0:01:06.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在1980年，改进型号TC-D5M问世，这个可以将声音录进金属磁带
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.54,0:01:06.32,Comments,,0,0,0,,注：相当于二类带（CrO2）和四类带
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.46,0:01:09.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,那个型号大概一直卖到2005年
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.10,0:01:16.46,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是1982年，又分出个新型号。新的Pro型号可以输入XLR麦克风信号
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.46,0:01:22.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Pro型号在1986改进了，然后一直卖到1999年，也许更迟
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.88,0:01:25.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以现在咱先不深入讨论他们之间的技术差异吧
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.14,0:01:28.76,Chinese,,0,0,0,,诸如不同的放大录音头或不同的麦克风放大线圈之类
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.96,0:01:32.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你们也许更加关心的是
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.80,0:01:36.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,"Pro"和"Pro II"型号只有XLR信号输入接口
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.74,0:01:43.48,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而面向普通消费者的呢，原版和"M"版本有RCA端口输入
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.68,0:01:45.18,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，输出也是一样
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.34,0:01:48.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在，让我们先停下脚步，咱先来谈谈户外录音机到底是啥
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.68,0:01:50.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因为他们现在仍在使用
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.54,0:01:52.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，现在人们更倾向用数字录音版的
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.88,0:01:55.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,有一些麦克风是用在广播站的
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.72,0:01:58.58,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他们不需要录像，将声音录在数码录音机上就OK了
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.58,0:02:01.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在上世纪80年代，这个道理也是适用的
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.68,0:02:04.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而人们更希望使用磁带录音机来完成这个目标
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.80,0:02:09.16,Chinese,,0,0,0,,对于广播来说，这就够用了，录音效果也还行
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.64,0:02:13.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，在这之前，人们用过开盘机来录音
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.90,0:02:16.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而户外录音机的历史正如录音技术的一样长
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.88,0:02:22.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,咱再回到六七十年代，当时电视经常使用16mm胶卷来录像
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.86,0:02:26.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你得单独接个录音机录音，并将其接入摄像机
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.92,0:02:32.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，在这之后，我们就将录音和录像功能给集合在一个机器上了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.06,0:02:35.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,那么户外录音机就更多地用在广播方面了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.26,0:02:37.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不久之前我在街上就被这样采访
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.74,0:02:41.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，不是这样的女装啊，像喜剧演员Dick Emery那样
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.42,0:02:44.64,Chinese,,0,0,0,,只是记者一只手拿着麦克
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.64,0:02:46.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,另一个肩膀上跨着一个磁带录音机
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.94,0:02:49.46,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个应该是给本地新闻用的
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.62,0:02:53.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当TC-D5问世的时候，当时大多的同类产品只能录单声道
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.70,0:02:56.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而TC-D5能录制相当不错的双声道录音
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.76,0:03:01.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因此这些设备都被用来录制Grateful Dead演唱会
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.12,0:03:05.58,Chinese,,0,0,0,,还有一个人天天带着TC-D5，他就是索尼创始人井深大
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.60,0:03:08.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他在出差的时候一直带着它
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.36,0:03:11.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,戴上耳机，听古典音乐
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.50,0:03:14.20,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这台机器续航能力强，但是比较笨重
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.20,0:03:19.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他在1979年的早期向盛田昭夫，当时索尼的主席，提起了这个东西
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.32,0:03:22.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后索尼就开发出了最早的Walkman了
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.88,0:03:25.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以好好想想吧，如果TC-D5没有存在过的话
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.84,0:03:28.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,也许Walkman就不会被发明出来
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.04,0:03:33.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,索尼将TC-D5称作是“高级的便携式卡座”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.52,0:03:38.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,并且一直带着这个名声卖这个，这个产品的销售周期也是相当地长
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.32,0:03:45.18,Chinese,,0,0,0,,看下以前的索尼产品目录，你会发现D5从八十年代到九十年代都有一席之地
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.26,0:03:49.06,Chinese,,0,0,0,,别的产品来来去去，但是他永远在那里
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.26,0:03:52.18,Comments,,0,0,0,,{\fnComic Sans MS\fs55}@President Putin
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.14,0:03:52.18,Chinese,,0,0,0,,TC-D5一直都在目录上
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.18,0:03:54.94,Chinese,,0,0,0,,如果这是辆车的话，那一定是这辆路虎了
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.94,0:03:58.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这辆车看上去跟几十年前的车十分相似
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.14,0:04:01.56,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是你不需要几年一换车，因为你上来就选对车了
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.56,0:04:04.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,对于TC-D5也是一样的吧
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.76,0:04:07.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是对于通常来说的，快速变化的消费级电子产品的话
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.90,0:04:10.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个东西就有点特立独行了
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.90,0:04:10.22,Comments,,0,0,0,,注：相当于AC-DC，无论时代如何发展，永远都是三和弦走天下
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.42,0:04:17.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当这个于1978年发售的时候，BBC还在用开盘机来做户外录音
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.10,0:04:22.58,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后这个一直度过了Walkman和小型数码录音机存在的年代
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.78,0:04:24.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后一直继续发光发热
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.68,0:04:27.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,一路步入二十一世纪
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.38,0:04:29.92,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我甚至在B&H产品目录上找到了这个
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.92,0:04:33.02,Chinese,,0,0,0,,那上面还有MiniDisc录音机啊
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.02,0:04:37.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,数字磁带录音机啊，可刻录光盘啊，硬盘啊；但除了这些以外
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.74,0:04:40.92,Chinese,,0,0,0,,D5 Pro II 仍然在那里
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.02,0:04:45.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,之所以我在那么多的型号中选择了Pro II型号，是因为这个是最终的版本
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.90,0:04:48.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,实际上它是在1986年出售的
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.78,0:04:52.48,Chinese,,0,0,0,,D5M型号则至少是在1980年出现的
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.76,0:04:58.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Pro II 型号有很多的提升，诸如循环录音，续航更持久
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.70,0:05:01.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,还有磁头上面的护套，防止噪音干扰，还有很多
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.24,0:05:06.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是Pro型号基本只能通过特别的产品目录，诸如B&H，来购买
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.00,0:05:09.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,如果你去上索尼的官网，他们他们仍然在做“专业级”产品
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.60,0:05:14.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你必须跳过平常的“消费级”产品介绍，一路到底才能看见专业级产品
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.04,0:05:17.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这些产品才是真正为了广播级别的
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.22,0:05:20.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,如果你看一下价格的话，你就知道为什么他们是专业级产品了
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.04,0:05:24.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,比如这个视点镜头相机要价75000美元（约合49万元）
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.82,0:05:30.64,Chinese,,0,0,0,,那你就会发现这个“专业级磁带录音机”是为消费市场设计的，而且质量很好
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.70,0:05:33.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,整个外壳是金属的，仅有几块塑料在这儿
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.80,0:05:38.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但整体来说，整个机器的做工十分地紧实
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.34,0:05:41.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,它被设计为按一下就能持续录音
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.70,0:05:44.76,Chinese,,0,0,0,,再看这个底部，你可以看到这个地方是由橡胶做的
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.76,0:05:48.24,Chinese,,0,0,0,,类似于保护套之类的，因为当你将其挂在你身上时
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.24,0:05:51.08,Chinese,,0,0,0,,要是drop it的话，那一端会先落地
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.28,0:05:54.40,Chinese,,0,0,0,,甚至电池仓都有一个金属盖
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.44,0:05:57.42,Chinese,,0,0,0,,听上去没啥，但是很少见
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.42,0:06:01.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,电池仓里面是两个一号电池
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.22,0:06:05.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,大约能续航四个半到五个小时
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.84,0:06:08.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，用这种外置电池是有好处的
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.32,0:06:10.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而不是使用内置电池的可充电设计
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.70,0:06:13.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,尤其是当你在户外录音到半截
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.54,0:06:15.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,录音机没电了，你怎么充电呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.08,0:06:18.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然而你可以身上多带几块电池
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.24,0:06:23.10,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我还看见有记载说用这个录制广播里的音乐
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.10,0:06:27.16,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他们还说在海啸过后，只有TC-D5能正常工作
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.24,0:06:30.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而那些更加现代化的MiniDisc录音机或数字磁带录音机全部罢工
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.46,0:06:36.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,还有，Pro II型号和D5M型号可以接普通的直流电电源
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.90,0:06:39.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然而，我觉得原版的Pro型号不能接
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.78,0:06:44.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我的上面本应该是直流电接口的地方，却是双声道和单声道转换按钮
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.88,0:06:46.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好的，现在我要给大家展示了
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.66,0:06:50.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我把录音机拿到户外，磁带上也录有东西
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.22,0:06:54.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我将播放磁带，并内录进摄像机。请大家欣赏
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.04,0:07:00.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,如果你想要开发一个专业级的户外录音机
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.00,0:07:02.75,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你不能把平常的机械结构直接应用在上面
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.75,0:07:05.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,随便塞进个外壳，再放块电池
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.38,0:07:07.48,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这是绝对不行的，因为当你移动录音机的时候
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.48,0:07:09.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,声音就会失真
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.38,0:07:11.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这是磁带转速的不同所导致的
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.60,0:07:15.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,一般大家将这种声音称作"哇~"或者"扑通"
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.12,0:07:19.64,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然而{\s1}鬼畜{\s0}摇晃这个录音机却没有失真，播放速度依旧平稳
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.84,0:07:23.46,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这都是索尼专门为这台机器开发的全新机械机构
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.46,0:07:24.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所发挥的作用
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.98,0:07:29.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这样的效果对于录制广播级别的高品质录音来说十分重要
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.50,0:07:32.06,Chinese,,0,0,0,,无论是在相对平静的新闻发布会中
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.06,0:07:36.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,还是在战地中，记者跨着它进行采访
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.64,0:07:40.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个小玩意确实很耐人！
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.84,0:07:43.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，现在的人们都在使用“固态设备”欣赏音乐
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.98,0:07:46.94,Chinese,,0,0,0,,没有可动的机械结构，自然也没有那么多失真

Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.90,0:07:54.08,Chinese,,0,0,0,,一切都要归功于这个精巧的电机设计，精巧到我都解释不了
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.08,0:07:55.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因为我对此不甚了解
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.74,0:07:59.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但应该是某种直连电机之类的吧，齿轮
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.00,0:08:03.08,Chinese,,0,0,0,,卡着齿轮，只顺着一个路子驱动，进而减少了

Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.58,0:08:12.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,确是精妙，后来 Sony D6C 专业级 Walkman 也使用了这个设计
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.52,0:08:17.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但我现在确实是无法演示这个的工作原理，所以咱还是注意其他的方面吧
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.66,0:08:20.08,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是我还是会给大家展示这个机器的方方面面
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.28,0:08:22.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,如果咱们从左手边的方向开始介绍的话
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.62,0:08:25.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们可以清晰地看到有个小东西十分突出
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.54,0:08:30.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,那个地方是系跨带的地方，另一侧也有一个
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.76,0:08:35.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在底下的一角有一个6.5mm的双声道话筒插口
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.32,0:08:37.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,上面有个控制音量的旋钮
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.82,0:08:40.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个同时也控制上面的扬声器音量
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.84,0:08:45.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个仅仅是一个单声道扬声器，仅仅为了回听你的录音，保证录上了东西
Dialogue: 0,0:08:45.70,0:08:47.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不是啥高级喇叭
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.54,0:08:52.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个按键是十分基本的钢琴按键，上世纪70年代的流行设计
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.54,0:08:55.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,后来就是一触即可的设计了
Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.38,0:08:59.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个按键十分普通，普通但是可靠
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.74,0:09:03.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,右手边的呢，是个VU表，表示左右声道音量大小
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.60,0:09:06.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,还有一些其他按键，我一会提到的
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.18,0:09:09.42,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这台机器没有开仓键，但是呢
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.42,0:09:13.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当你手动掀开仓门后，你可以看到很多其他的水平开关
Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.32,0:09:17.46,Chinese,,0,0,0,,一个是控制杜比B降噪功能的开关，一个是选择磁带类型的
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.46,0:09:20.20,Chinese,,0,0,0,,是一类铁带还是三类铬铁带
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.40,0:09:25.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我之前提过，三类带是个短命的磁带类型，在市场存在时间较短

Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.58,0:09:30.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然而，这个还能自动侦测二类铬带
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.18,0:09:34.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,利用后面的这个小机构。它可以播放四类金属带，但是录不了
Dialogue: 0,0:09:34.86,0:09:41.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,如果你有录制铁带的需要，你得用TC-D5M型号,其中"M"即指金属(metal)
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.70,0:09:44.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这就有点不同寻常了，消费级产品可以录四类金属带
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.62,0:09:47.91,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而专业级的就不行
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.92,0:09:51.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,有人解释为录制四类金属带可能更耗电
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.34,0:09:53.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以没有这个功能，录音时间还能更长些
Dialogue: 0,0:09:53.54,0:09:57.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过现在无所谓了，因为四类金属带十分难找
Dialogue: 0,0:09:57.96,0:10:00.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,并且你都可以录制并播放二类铬带或是一类铁带
Dialogue: 0,0:10:00.84,0:10:03.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个估计就是你手上所有的磁带类型了
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.84,0:10:05.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在咱来谈谈回放磁带
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.16,0:10:11.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个微小的机械结构播放磁带的效果还挺好，无论是什么类型的磁带
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.98,0:10:16.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,只要播放的磁带的录制效果很好，这个东西回放磁带
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.94,0:10:21.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,效果很好，好到某些发烧级卡座都没有那么好
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.64,0:10:26.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而且机器播放时的效果还很好，我对VU表来回动十分厌恶
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.32,0:10:29.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我还需要指出的是左面的表是一个电池指示器
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.90,0:10:33.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,如果我按下那个按钮，你可以看到指针不动了
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.62,0:10:36.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而它指向的位置即为电量的剩余值
Dialogue: 0,0:10:36.26,0:10:42.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而且这个还能开启一点背光，尽管暗到你看不到，而且只是亮一小会
Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.88,0:10:44.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当你使用这个机器有一会的时候
Dialogue: 0,0:10:44.44,0:10:48.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你就开始觉得这个机器的细节真的是走心了
Dialogue: 0,0:10:48.00,0:10:50.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,一些十分基本的东西，诸如这里的弹出按钮
Dialogue: 0,0:10:50.36,0:10:54.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,还有一个小的杠杆，用来将磁带从机器里弹出来
Dialogue: 0,0:10:54.36,0:10:56.76,Chinese,,0,0,0,,就是那么地小，但是工作得很好
Dialogue: 0,0:10:56.76,0:10:59.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,都这么好了，你还想期待什么呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.76,0:11:03.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，如果你想用这个播放音乐，你肯定不想用
Dialogue: 0,0:11:03.72,0:11:08.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,内置扬声器，因为这个扬声器很小，仅仅是用来让你知道
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.80,0:11:10.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,磁带上到底录了什么
Dialogue: 0,0:11:10.50,0:11:13.40,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你必须要将其插入某种外置功放
Dialogue: 0,0:11:13.40,0:11:18.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,或者你可以通过RCA插口来插入外置音箱，像我这样
Dialogue: 0,0:11:18.60,0:11:20.28,Chinese,,0,0,0,,效果确实有很大不同
Dialogue: 0,0:11:27.08,0:11:30.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我之所以上回用这个机器来演示Atari Video Music
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.02,0:11:34.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,是因为你可以有同时两个音频输出
Dialogue: 0,0:11:34.60,0:11:39.28,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以我可以通过RCA输出直到Atari那里，前面我再利用耳机输出
Dialogue: 0,0:11:39.28,0:11:42.20,Chinese,,0,0,0,,插入相机，因为我把所有东西都录到相机里
Dialogue: 0,0:11:42.26,0:11:45.48,Chinese,,0,0,0,,说道录音，你可以看到这里有一个录音音量旋钮
Dialogue: 0,0:11:45.48,0:11:47.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,金属做的，还是暗灰色的
Dialogue: 0,0:11:47.90,0:11:51.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,整个东西摸上去很有质感，整合得真不错
Dialogue: 0,0:11:51.78,0:11:54.29,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是，如你所见，你可以分别调整左右两个声道
Dialogue: 0,0:11:54.30,0:11:57.46,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，在采访的时候，他们兴许一个人一个麦克风
Dialogue: 0,0:11:57.46,0:11:59.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你可以调整两个麦克风的音量了
Dialogue: 0,0:12:00.06,0:12:01.92,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然而，如果你想将什么东西插入到这俩大接口的话
Dialogue: 0,0:12:01.92,0:12:08.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你得搞条RCA端口至麦克风专用XLR接口的转接线
Dialogue: 0,0:12:08.72,0:12:11.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当你将这些插入之后
Dialogue: 0,0:12:11.98,0:12:17.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,诸如我这样，一端插入CD播放机，另一端插入TC-D5
Dialogue: 0,0:12:17.86,0:12:23.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你会发现信号输出有点“强”，比麦克风输出还要高
Dialogue: 0,0:12:23.98,0:12:27.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以，如果你就这样插，按下录音键的话
Dialogue: 0,0:12:27.00,0:12:29.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你可以看到音频信号一直非常强
Dialogue: 0,0:12:29.68,0:12:33.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,上面在“录制灯”旁边的“强度”灯，也是非常亮的
Dialogue: 0,0:12:33.32,0:12:37.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你可以看到，我就稍微旋转了一下，VU表就直接最强了
Dialogue: 0,0:12:37.18,0:12:43.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以说，线缆输出需要将麦克风输入电平降低一下
Dialogue: 0,0:12:43.54,0:12:46.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,幸好，这个旁边有个开关，可以将信号降低20分贝
Dialogue: 0,0:12:46.84,0:12:52.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以我们那么做的话，我们可以将信号电平降低，就可以录了
Dialogue: 0,0:12:52.86,0:12:56.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,呃，虽然我不知道这样做好不好，但是这样也行
Dialogue: 0,0:12:56.74,0:13:00.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以我就这样继续旋转。没错，右面底下也有一个限制音量开关
Dialogue: 0,0:13:00.54,0:13:03.64,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我注意到如果我一路往上旋转这个，我们的信号就太强了
Dialogue: 0,0:13:03.64,0:13:08.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,开启限制音量开关的话，机器就会尽量将信号电平放在一个合理的区间内
Dialogue: 0,0:13:08.58,0:13:10.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个在录制比较吵的音乐会
Dialogue: 0,0:13:10.80,0:13:13.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,或者在噪音会很大的音乐会上会有点用
Dialogue: 0,0:13:13.54,0:13:17.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你肯定想限制这些信号，这样就不会破音，或者音量过大了
Dialogue: 0,0:13:18.30,0:13:20.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你也注意到了，我的这台机器品相不错
Dialogue: 0,0:13:20.90,0:13:24.94,Chinese,,0,0,0,,实际上，这上面只有在黑漆这里有两处小小的抓痕
Dialogue: 0,0:13:24.94,0:13:27.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后就没啦。这台机子品相好的原因在于
Dialogue: 0,0:13:27.92,0:13:30.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们有一个保护套
Dialogue: 0,0:13:30.34,0:13:32.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个对于户外录音机来说，是相当不错的
Dialogue: 0,0:13:32.52,0:13:36.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他们一般会附带保护套，所以只要之前的所有者
Dialogue: 0,0:13:36.88,0:13:39.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,将机器放在里面，大概率机器上没有什么明显的爪痕和信号
Dialogue: 0,0:13:39.86,0:13:43.28,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而这在现在的老机器上十分常见
Dialogue: 0,0:13:43.58,0:13:45.58,Chinese,,0,0,0,,如你所见，只要将其放入保护套中
Dialogue: 0,0:13:45.58,0:13:48.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,机子上挂跨带的地方就能穿过保护套上的洞
Dialogue: 0,0:13:48.70,0:13:51.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后跨带应该就可以挂在保护套上了
Dialogue: 0,0:13:52.34,0:13:57.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我的保护套上有一些爪痕和污渍，有些地方的皮革开始脱位
Dialogue: 0,0:13:57.34,0:13:59.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是它尽到了本分，保护了机器
Dialogue: 0,0:13:59.56,0:14:04.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,实际上，你可以不把机器从保护套里拿出来，就能换磁带
Dialogue: 0,0:14:04.16,0:14:08.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你需要拿出来的唯一情况，就是换电池
Dialogue: 0,0:14:08.52,0:14:13.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,虽然索尼卖TC-D5的时长超过了其他的同类产品
Dialogue: 0,0:14:13.66,0:14:19.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是其他厂家仍然在其售卖期间推出了一些竞争品
Dialogue: 0,0:14:19.44,0:14:23.10,Chinese,,0,0,0,,其中一家为大众所知的是 Marantz，这个机器呢
Dialogue: 0,0:14:23.30,0:14:27.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在某些地方确实与TC-D5非常相似
Dialogue: 0,0:14:27.44,0:14:31.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个型号是CP430，在欧洲售卖的型号
Dialogue: 0,0:14:32.04,0:14:34.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在美国，它被称为PMD430
Dialogue: 0,0:14:34.84,0:14:38.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,它有Dolby B降噪功能，但也能进行dbx降噪
Dialogue: 0,0:14:39.04,0:14:42.46,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我手里只有这个机器，我几周前才买到手
Dialogue: 0,0:14:42.46,0:14:45.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,确实是专业级的，可以录制二类铬带和四类金属带
Dialogue: 0,0:14:45.88,0:14:50.03,Chinese,,0,0,0,,看底下，你可以看到有音高和左右平衡控制
Dialogue: 0,0:14:50.04,0:14:52.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个机器有三个磁头
Dialogue: 0,0:14:52.80,0:14:57.08,Chinese,,0,0,0,,也就是说，我可以边录音边监听
Dialogue: 0,0:14:57.12,0:15:00.25,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你还可以按下底部的这个按钮来监听磁带
Dialogue: 0,0:15:00.25,0:15:02.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,或者是音乐
Dialogue: 0,0:15:02.36,0:15:06.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,要说功能呢，这玩意可谓是甩了索尼的机器十万八千里了
Dialogue: 0,0:15:06.52,0:15:10.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是机器质量呢，索尼显然更胜一筹
Dialogue: 0,0:15:10.96,0:15:13.10,Chinese,,0,0,0,,索尼的机器是全金属设计
Dialogue: 0,0:15:13.30,0:15:16.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而这个的外壳却是脆弱易碎的塑料:-(
Dialogue: 0,0:15:16.42,0:15:18.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,索尼的机器拿在手里很有分量
Dialogue: 0,0:15:18.12,0:15:20.24,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这玩意嘛，拿手里更像是空的塑料盒子
Dialogue: 0,0:15:20.24,0:15:23.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,读带子读了一会后，好像放带子时的失真
Dialogue: 0,0:15:24.00,0:15:26.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,对于这个机器来说，还是很多的
Dialogue: 0,0:15:26.84,0:15:29.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我在看这个视频研究的时候，我发现
Dialogue: 0,0:15:32.48,0:15:34.39,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我注意到BBC用的是这个Uher 4400录音机
Dialogue: 0,0:15:34.40,0:15:39.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我还看到eBay上面还有卖的，描述是"ex-BBC"，还有很多邮票之类的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:15:39.60,0:15:42.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好吧，当他们换下这个的时候，他们没有使用TC-D5
Dialogue: 0,0:15:42.78,0:15:47.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他们使用的更新到型号，索尼D6C
Dialogue: 0,0:15:47.40,0:15:49.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,一般被认为是更高端的Walkman
Dialogue: 0,0:15:49.98,0:15:53.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但这个确实是一个复杂的小型便捷磁带录音机
Dialogue: 0,0:15:53.04,0:16:00.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,可以用Dolby C降噪，可以录在四类铁带上，这两件事我的D5一个都干不了
