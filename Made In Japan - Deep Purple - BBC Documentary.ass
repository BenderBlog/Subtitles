Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.83,0:00:48.27,English,,0,0,0,,It was Made In Japan, that threw it into the stratosphere.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.65,0:00:50.86,English,,0,0,0,,We did the same songs, on stage
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.86,0:00:53.81,English,,0,0,0,,and it seemed to take off that much bigger than Machine Head.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.02,0:01:04.64,English,,0,0,0,,On the night.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.42,0:01:07.88,English,,0,0,0,,And then, people started to break down.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.78,0:01:12.79,English,,0,0,0,,'72, I think we made, two albums, six US tours.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.85,0:01:19.65,English,,0,0,0,,Something happened. Ritchie and Ian Gillan agreed to disagree.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.12,0:01:21.51,English,,0,0,0,,I wrote a letter saying I was going to leave.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.48,0:01:24.76,English,,0,0,0,,No-one said anything, so I assumed they wanted me to leave.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.04,0:01:27.10,English,,0,0,0,,It was just pressure pressure, pressure
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.21,0:01:30.09,English,,0,0,0,,and that's exactly why that split happened.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.19,0:02:12.21,English,,0,0,0,,We started in '68, Jon Lord and myself, and we put the band together
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.66,0:02:15.54,English,,0,0,0,,and I don't think we quite knew what direction that we had.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.59,0:02:20.92,English,,0,0,0,,Aehh, we kind of uhmm... flim flammed around in certain areas.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.24,0:02:25.28,English,,0,0,0,,I think the first album was a recording of everything we'd learnt.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.55,0:02:27.93,English,,0,0,0,,I don't think we had anything else. I think that was it.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.60,0:02:33.25,English,,0,0,0,,Aehh... couple of original bits and pieces and then quite a lot of covers.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.63,0:02:44.24,English,,0,0,0,,The highs were the interaction that, uhmm... Ritchie, Jon and I found, we each other

Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.06,0:03:09.92,English,,0,0,0,,As we were staggering into 1969 Ritchie and I, particularly
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.28,0:03:13.65,English,,0,0,0,,realised that the band was, in danger of not being quite what we'd
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.65,0:03:15.13,English,,0,0,0,,seen it as in our minds.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.13,0:03:17.62,English,,0,0,0,,It was kind of a little bit... pop.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.64,0:03:27.12,English,,0,0,0,,There we are, like, really searching for an identity
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.70,0:03:30.75,English,,0,0,0,,and that search goes on, pretty much through the first three albums.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.93,0:03:33.80,English,,0,0,0,,A friend of mine had a singer in his band, it was Ian Gillan.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.90,0:03:36.41,English,,0,0,0,,So we tried out Ian. He had the scream, he had the look
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.56,0:03:39.94,English,,0,0,0,,and that's why in 1970 we were on our way.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.23,0:03:42.02,English,,0,0,0,,Good morning. And how are you?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.47,0:03:53.94,English,,0,0,0,,Then, of course, In Rock came out, you know, and that became
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.14,0:03:57.30,English,,0,0,0,,a phenomenon in the British charts in the top ten for over a year.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.88,0:04:01.62,English,,0,0,0,,It hit a chord with the British youth and Europe.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.95,0:04:10.14,English,,0,0,0,,When we saw what In Rock had done, it was a calling card.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.84,0:04:12.59,English,,0,0,0,,It said: this is Deep Purple.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.87,0:04:14.50,English,,0,0,0,,Everybody in the band was absolutely behind it
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.70,0:04:17.95,English,,0,0,0,,and that lasted pretty much into the Machine Head era.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.55,0:04:26.67,English,,0,0,0,,Deep Purple In Rock stayed in the charts for over a year.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.88,0:04:27.81,English,,0,0,0,,Big success to follow.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.01,0:04:30.14,English,,0,0,0,,I think there was a feeling of: what do we do next?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.34,0:04:31.67,English,,0,0,0,,How do we top that?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.03,0:04:52.04,English,,0,0,0,,Fireball, there was a kind of certain intimidation going on
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.04,0:04:54.75,English,,0,0,0,,and by the time it was finished I think we were a little tired.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.46,0:04:59.98,English,,0,0,0,,Fireball was lots of fun, but it was a little more introvert.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.95,0:05:05.63,English,,0,0,0,,And there's still some great tracks on it, but it didn't fire up
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.63,0:05:08.03,English,,0,0,0,,the imagination of the public the way that In Rock did.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.78,0:05:30.60,English,,0,0,0,,Fireball, it's a troublesome... album because, to me
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.00,0:05:34.01,English,,0,0,0,,you couldn't have had Fireball without In Rock.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.12,0:05:40.07,English,,0,0,0,,But you couldn't have Machine Head without Fireball, so it sits
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.27,0:05:42.95,English,,0,0,0,,very nicely as part of those three
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.64,0:05:47.00,English,,0,0,0,,really... good rock albums.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.41,0:05:54.56,English,,0,0,0,,The success that In Rock and not quite so much Fireball
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.56,0:05:58.05,English,,0,0,0,,gave us, allowed us to say: "OK, the next time round, we're going to get
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.57,0:06:02.52,English,,0,0,0,,a situation where once we've got the sound, three weeks
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.29,0:06:05.54,English,,0,0,0,,"we've got the songs together we just record them," you know?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.08,0:06:07.36,English,,0,0,0,,And that's what we did with Machine Head.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.80,0:06:26.37,English,,0,0,0,,Although we were wildly successful
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.10,0:06:29.77,English,,0,0,0,,Deep Purple In Rock and Fireball
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.82,0:06:33.51,English,,0,0,0,,uhmm... we actually hadn't made much money
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.07,0:06:37.57,English,,0,0,0,,because... we were paying back the management for...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.61,0:06:40.93,English,,0,0,0,,having funded the band for so many years.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.14,0:06:46.82,English,,0,0,0,,So despite all that success, you know, we needed to makes money.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.05,0:07:12.29,English,,0,0,0,,In 1971, the law changed.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.33,0:07:18.38,English,,0,0,0,,{\pos(940,160)}If a recording is done overseas, so long as the overseas derived income
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.51,0:07:22.38,English,,0,0,0,,{\pos(940,160)}wasn't remitted into the UK it wasn't taxed in the UK.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.63,0:07:25.93,English,,0,0,0,,What happened was that the boys had to become tax exiles.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.30,0:07:30.15,English,,0,0,0,,That is a process which saved a huge amount of money.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.63,0:07:37.10,English,,0,0,0,,We had an accountant at the time called Bill Reid
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.44,0:07:39.98,English,,0,0,0,,a brilliant guy, and he cooked up this scheme.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.98,0:07:42.82,English,,0,0,0,,He said: "Look, if you write songs and record them
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.02,0:07:45.73,English,,0,0,0,,"outside of the country, you won't be taxed English tax
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.73,0:07:48.11,English,,0,0,0,,"you're only taxed on what you earn in England."
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.44,0:07:54.71,English,,0,0,0,,And we travelled the Continent so it wasn't a big problem for us to do that.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.68,0:07:59.84,English,,0,0,0,,We took specialist tax advice that in order for the boys to get
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.09,0:08:03.23,English,,0,0,0,,the benefit of whatever they might do in the future, they would
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.23,0:08:07.80,English,,0,0,0,,have to have an employment as opposed to a partnership.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.37,0:08:13.31,English,,0,0,0,,As it was considered that their next album, which they had yet to record
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.51,0:08:17.15,English,,0,0,0,,or even write, was going to be the biggest that they would have had
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.15,0:08:19.95,English,,0,0,0,,yet because of the rising success in album sales
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.20,0:08:24.94,English,,0,0,0,,that we would institute the employment regime by having a company
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.11,0:08:26.62,English,,0,0,0,,which was an English company
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.80,0:08:31.68,English,,0,0,0,,but it employed the artists only for their overseas activities.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.82,0:08:35.93,English,,0,0,0,,And the next album which they did, which was Machine Head
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.25,0:08:38.67,English,,0,0,0,,made that a very wise decision.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.47,0:08:43.11,English,,0,0,0,,So we thought we'd record an album under studio conditions
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.31,0:08:44.46,English,,0,0,0,,but in a live venue.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.16,0:08:52.43,English,,0,0,0,,Claude Nobs was the instigator of us going to Switzerland
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.71,0:08:58.52,English,,0,0,0,,and Claude said that he could set us up with something over there
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.82,0:09:00.99,English,,0,0,0,,which was the Casino to record at the Casino.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.88,0:10:16.72,English,,0,0,0,,Under the new regime and under their employment contracts
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.86,0:10:21.87,English,,0,0,0,,had to record overseas. The question then would be, where to go.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:22.36,0:10:28.38,English,,0,0,0,,And the band and Tony and Jon looked around and spoke to Claude Nobs
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.15,0:10:31.67,English,,0,0,0,,who was a promoter on the Continent.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:31.86,0:10:35.46,English,,0,0,0,,Claude Nobs, our friend from Montreux, he did the jazz festival.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:36.25,0:10:38.19,English,,0,0,0,,He said, "We've got tonnes of space here.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.39,0:10:39.28,English,,0,0,0,,You can do it here.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:39.49,0:10:43.40,English,,0,0,0,,We'll find a place in the Casino which is closed for the winter.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:43.46,0:10:44.37,English,,0,0,0,,Everyone knows the story.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:33.13,0:11:37.35,English,,0,0,0,,That was probably the best times of Purple back then
Dialogue: 0,0:11:38.18,0:11:42.92,English,,0,0,0,,and when we arranged to go to Switzerland to do this album
Dialogue: 0,0:11:43.70,0:11:45.62,English,,0,0,0,,it was just a fantastic time you know?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:45.70,0:11:48.12,English,,0,0,0,,Unfortunately, the Casino burned down
Dialogue: 0,0:11:48.71,0:11:51.05,English,,0,0,0,,but out of that sprang the song, of course.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:51.69,0:11:54.06,English,,0,0,0,,Without that, there would have been no Smoke On The Water.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:58.11,0:12:00.28,English,,0,0,0,,Why did you go to Switzerland to record Machine Head?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:00.56,0:12:06.53,English,,0,0,0,,Several reasons. One being it's a great place to be, Montreux.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:06.55,0:12:10.75,English,,0,0,0,,We know a lot of people in Montreux. And it was a nice place to go.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:11.90,0:12:15.14,English,,0,0,0,,The second, because we used The Rolling Stones' mobile unit
Dialogue: 0,0:12:15.68,0:12:20.92,English,,0,0,0,,and that was in the South of France and it was easy to trundle it up to Switzerland.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:21.99,0:12:29.79,English,,0,0,0,,Humm... And thirdly, money reasons tax reasons. It's... It's...
Dialogue: 0,0:12:30.13,0:12:35.79,English,,0,0,0,,You can avoid paying some tax on your albums, on your royalties
Dialogue: 0,0:12:36.11,0:12:37.89,English,,0,0,0,,if you've made the album out of the country.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:38.04,0:12:40.42,English,,0,0,0,,It's a very complicated deal but it's not illegal.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:40.62,0:12:43.38,English,,0,0,0,,I mean, tax people know about it but it's just if you want to take
Dialogue: 0,0:12:43.38,0:12:45.54,English,,0,0,0,,advantage of it, you have to record outside the country.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:46.13,0:12:48.76,English,,0,0,0,,And also, we did it in two weeks
Dialogue: 0,0:12:50.09,0:12:52.64,English,,0,0,0,,aheh, where normally we take three or four months over an album
Dialogue: 0,0:12:52.64,0:12:56.43,English,,0,0,0,,on and off, but we just had a concentrated two weeks playing, you know
Dialogue: 0,0:12:56.84,0:12:58.97,English,,0,0,0,,We'd written all the songs and we just went in and recorded.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:00.55,0:13:02.57,English,,0,0,0,,The Casino in Montreux, Switzerland

Dialogue: 0,0:13:08.15,0:13:11.20,English,,0,0,0,,And the guy who was organising it, Claude Nobs, said:

Dialogue: 0,0:13:30.25,0:13:31.82,English,,0,0,0,,And about an hour into the show
Dialogue: 0,0:13:32.83,0:13:36.16,English,,0,0,0,,someone fired a flare gun into the ceiling, which was made of...
Dialogue: 0,0:13:36.29,0:13:37.78,English,,0,0,0,,It was like a false ceiling, bamboo.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:39.41,0:13:43.32,English,,0,0,0,,And there wasn't much of a fire at first, but things came to
Dialogue: 0,0:13:43.96,0:13:46.65,English,,0,0,0,,a halt and everyone was ordered to leave the building.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:47.55,0:13:50.63,English,,0,0,0,,And there was a little bit of a panic, but not bad.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:50.63,0:13:52.16,English,,0,0,0,,No-one was hurt strangely enough.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:52.88,0:13:56.13,English,,0,0,0,,And literally within five minutes or so, the place was an inferno.

Dialogue: 0,0:14:41.78,0:14:43.21,English,,0,0,0,,The fire had started in the ceiling
Dialogue: 0,0:14:43.22,0:14:46.64,English,,0,0,0,,and it spread without anyone seeing it and it was a huge building

Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.00,0:00:59.46,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这张专辑是我们乐队最漂亮的一出
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.97,0:01:03.31,Chinese,,0,0,0,,大家很快地做出来，并上台演出
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.02,0:01:04.64,Chinese,,0,0,0,,就在一夜之间
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.42,0:01:07.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后，大家就开始为此疯狂
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.78,0:01:12.79,Chinese,,0,0,0,,记得1972年，我们录了两张专辑，在美国巡演了六次
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.85,0:01:19.65,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后就出事了，Blackmore和Gillan开始干架了:-(
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.12,0:01:21.51,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我给他们写下了辞职信
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.48,0:01:24.76,Chinese,,0,0,0,,没有任何人说啥，所以我想我还是卷铺盖走人吧
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.04,0:01:27.10,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在那时，整个情况就是压力，压力，和压力
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.21,0:01:30.09,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这也就是为啥我们拆伙了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.19,0:02:12.21,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们1968年创建了这个乐队，和Jon Lord一起
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.66,0:02:15.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们当时并不清楚我们的方向
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.59,0:02:20.92,Chinese,,0,0,0,,额，我们当时就像是......仅仅在一片小区域内燃烧的火焰
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.24,0:02:25.28,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我认为第一张专辑仅仅是把我们所知的全都录了进去
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.55,0:02:27.93,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后好像就没啥了，应该就是这样了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.60,0:02:33.25,Chinese,,0,0,0,,额......一些原创歌曲和超级多的翻唱
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.63,0:02:44.24,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好的方面在于我们间的交流......Blackmore，Lord和我
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.63,0:02:46.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在音乐和个性方面找到了共性
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.26,0:02:48.30,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们当时相处得不错
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.29,0:02:57.71,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后坏的方面是......我们很快意识到，当时
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.39,0:03:02.43,Chinese,,0,0,0,,的乐队因为成员风格问题，不可能发展得更远
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.06,0:03:09.92,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当我们在1969年时还在艰难发展时，黑多多和我
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.28,0:03:13.65,Chinese,,0,0,0,,意识到乐队正处于偏离我们正常轨道
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.65,0:03:15.13,Chinese,,0,0,0,,的危险之中
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.13,0:03:17.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这乐队有点......太流行了
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.64,0:03:27.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后我们就努力地寻求我们的定位
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.70,0:03:30.75,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后我们一直在寻求，贯穿了前三张专辑
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.93,0:03:33.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我的一个朋友介绍了他乐队的歌手，Ian Gillan
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.90,0:03:36.41,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以我们面试了他，他能喊到天，颜值也不错
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.56,0:03:39.94,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而这就是为什么1970年时我们开始上道了
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.23,0:03:42.02,Chinese,,0,0,0,,早上好啊！感觉如何？
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.47,0:03:53.94,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后，很自然地，In Rock出版了，你们都知道，然后
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.14,0:03:57.30,Chinese,,0,0,0,,它就火遍了英国，在排行榜前十的位置上待了一年
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.88,0:04:01.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,它迎合了英国年轻人和欧洲年轻人的激情
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.95,0:04:10.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当我们看到In Rock完工的时候，我感受到他就是我们的名片

Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.87,0:04:14.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,每个人都为专辑的制作作出了贡献
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.70,0:04:17.95,Chinese,,0,0,0,,并且这个状况一直延续到Machine Head的制作
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.55,0:04:26.67,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Deep Purple In Rock 在排行榜上待了超过一年
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.88,0:04:27.81,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这之后我们还要更上一层楼
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.01,0:04:30.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们当时就很迷茫：接下来我们要做什么？
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.34,0:04:31.67,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们如何超越这个成功？
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.03,0:04:52.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Fireball, 这个名字体现出我们的影响力（威胁）有多大
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.04,0:04:54.75,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当我们完成这张专辑的时候，我们身心俱疲
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.46,0:04:59.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,做Fireball时我们确实很欢乐，但也把我们搞得有点社恐
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.95,0:05:05.63,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然这张专辑里也有好歌，但是它没有
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.63,0:05:08.03,Chinese,,0,0,0,,像我们想的一样火起来，没有达到 In Rock 的地步
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.78,0:05:30.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Fireball，这张专辑是张很尴尬的专辑，因为
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.00,0:05:34.01,Chinese,,0,0,0,,对我而言，如果没有In Rock ，就不可能Fireball
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.12,0:05:40.07,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是要是没有Fireball，你不可能有Machine Head
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.27,0:05:47.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以这张专辑正好夹在这两座大山的中间:-(
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.41,0:05:54.56,Chinese,,0,0,0,,In Rock很成功，但是Fireball就没有
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.56,0:05:58.05,Chinese,,0,0,0,,那么成功了，我们就在想：”好吧，我们来这么做
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.57,0:06:02.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,只要有人想出旋律的话，几周之内我们
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.29,0:06:05.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,就写好歌曲，攒好后就赶紧录，明白了吧？
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.08,0:06:07.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们就是这么录的Machine Head
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.80,0:06:26.37,Chinese,,0,0,0,,尽管我们已经十分成功了
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.10,0:06:29.77,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在发行In Rock和Fireball之后
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.82,0:06:33.51,Chinese,,0,0,0,,额......我们实际上没有赚到很多的钱
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.07,0:06:37.57,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因为我们当时得把钱给为我们乐队
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.61,0:06:40.93,Chinese,,0,0,0,,投资了许多钱的经纪人们
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.14,0:06:46.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以我们尽管很成功，但是你明白，我们急需赚钱
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.05,0:07:12.29,Chinese,,0,0,0,,1971年的时候，法规变了

Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.30,0:07:30.15,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个过程确实帮助我们省了好多的钱
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.63,0:07:37.10,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们那时有个会计，叫做Bill Reid
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.44,0:07:39.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他脑袋瓜子很溜，然后他策划了整个计划
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.98,0:07:42.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他说：“同志们，如果你们在国外写歌
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.02,0:07:45.73,Chinese,,0,0,0,,录歌，你们就不会为此在英国上税
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.73,0:07:48.11,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你们仅需为你们在英国挣到的钱上税就行了。”
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.44,0:07:54.71,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后我们就去欧洲大陆了，对我们来说，这不是事
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.68,0:07:59.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们征询了许多税收专家的意见，让他们可以
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.09,0:08:03.23,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在将来做任何事的时候都可以由此收益，他们必须
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.23,0:08:07.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,要和公司有签约，而不是合作关系
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.37,0:08:13.31,Chinese,,0,0,0,,正如我们所想，他们的下一张专辑，也就是当时他们还没有录制
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.51,0:08:17.15,Chinese,,0,0,0,,甚至于还没写的专辑，将要获得前所未有的成功
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.15,0:08:19.95,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因为他们名声越来越大，销量越来越好
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.20,0:08:24.94,Chinese,,0,0,0,,那么我们计划为我们的雇员建立一个公司
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.11,0:08:26.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这是个英国公司
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.80,0:08:31.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是这个公司只雇在海外活动的艺术家
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.82,0:08:35.93,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后他们录的下一张专辑，就是Machine Head
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.25,0:08:38.67,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这就让这个决定十分明智了
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.47,0:08:43.11,Chinese,,0,0,0,,那么我们就想在表演场地中
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.31,0:08:44.46,Chinese,,0,0,0,,建立一个录音室的环境，来录制专辑
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.16,0:08:52.43,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Claude Nobs 怂恿我们去瑞士
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.71,0:08:58.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他说他可以把我们安顿个地方来录专辑
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.82,0:09:00.99,Chinese,,0,0,0,,那个地方是个娱乐场
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.88,0:10:16.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在全新的公司和全新合约的要求下
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.86,0:10:21.87,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们必须在海外录专辑。那么问题来了，我们去哪录呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:10:22.36,0:10:28.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后整个乐队和他们的经纪人找了一圈，最后找到了Claude Nobs
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.15,0:10:31.67,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当时他是欧洲大陆上的演唱会筹办人

Dialogue: 0,0:11:38.18,0:11:42.92,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后我们组织好，去瑞士录这张专辑
Dialogue: 0,0:11:43.70,0:11:45.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你知道吗，那时可真是好时候啊！
Dialogue: 0,0:11:45.70,0:11:48.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,可惜的是，那个赌场被烧毁了:-(
Dialogue: 0,0:11:48.71,0:11:51.05,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而这就是那首歌的灵感来源

Dialogue: 0,0:11:58.11,0:12:00.28,Chinese,,0,0,0,,为什么你们要去瑞士录Machine Head？
Dialogue: 0,0:12:00.56,0:12:06.53,Chinese,,0,0,0,,原因很多。第一，Montreux那个地方很不错
Dialogue: 0,0:12:06.55,0:12:10.75,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们认识很多那里的朋友，而且十分宜人
Dialogue: 0,0:12:11.90,0:12:15.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,第二，因为我们用了滚石乐队的移动录音工作室
Dialogue: 0,0:12:15.68,0:12:20.92,Chinese,,0,0,0,,那个东西是在法国南部，所以将其运到瑞士就很容易了
Dialogue: 0,0:12:21.99,0:12:29.79,Chinese,,0,0,0,,额，第三嘛，就是资金问题，税收问题了。这个就......
Dialogue: 0,0:12:30.13,0:12:35.79,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你可以不用为你录的专辑上税，也不用交版税
Dialogue: 0,0:12:36.11,0:12:37.89,Chinese,,0,0,0,,只要你在国外录制专辑的话
Dialogue: 0,0:12:38.04,0:12:40.42,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个过程十分复杂，但是这个不违法
Dialogue: 0,0:12:40.62,0:12:43.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我是说，纳税人都知道，但是如果你想由此
Dialogue: 0,0:12:43.38,0:12:45.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,获益的话，你必须得在国外录制专辑
Dialogue: 0,0:12:46.13,0:12:48.76,Chinese,,0,0,0,,还有，我们花了两周录了这个
Dialogue: 0,0:12:50.09,0:12:52.64,Chinese,,0,0,0,,呃，一般我们要花三四周录制一张专辑
Dialogue: 0,0:12:52.64,0:12:56.43,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是我们当时只是专注地花了两周录制
Dialogue: 0,0:12:56.84,0:12:58.97,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们写完了歌，然后就进棚录制了
Dialogue: 0,0:13:00.55,0:13:02.57,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Montreux那里的赌场了

Dialogue: 0,0:19:37.98,0:19:43.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,说真的，我们当时没有认为Smoke On The Water将是个大热门
Dialogue: 0,0:19:47.78,0:19:48.56,Chinese,,0,0,0,,怎么会是这样呢？

Dialogue: 0,0:20:51.36,0:20:55.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,嗯，实际上，直到Made In Japan这张
Dialogue: 0,0:20:56.35,0:20:59.46,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现场专辑的发行后，这张专辑才生动了起来
Dialogue: 0,0:20:59.46,0:21:00.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,是的，这是张热门专辑
Dialogue: 0,0:21:00.74,0:21:05.65,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是，Made In Japan的发行使这张专辑直接冲上了天
Dialogue: 0,0:21:20.72,0:21:26.05,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Made In Japan实际上一开始是日本唱片公司的主意

Dialogue: 0,0:21:45.96,0:21:46.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这就是专辑名称的由来了
Dialogue: 0,0:22:24.07,0:22:26.56,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Made In Japan，当然是有点玩笑的意味在

Dialogue: 0,0:30:34.52,0:30:38.61,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你在台上演出时总得表演些什么
Dialogue: 0,0:30:38.81,0:30:41.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,要是表演的好的话，你就会想在另一晚再演一次
Dialogue: 0,0:30:42.08,0:30:47.16,Chinese,,0,0,0,,那么歌曲之间或者段落之间的一小段即兴
Dialogue: 0,0:30:47.16,0:30:51.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,演奏就成为我们的第二本能了
Dialogue: 0,0:31:01.42,0:31:06.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,对于我而言，这就是这就是在舞台上表演时
Dialogue: 0,0:31:06.89,0:31:10.18,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你所缺少的摇滚因素
Dialogue: 0,0:31:10.36,0:31:12.67,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你不知道接下来要演什么
Dialogue: 0,0:31:13.15,0:31:15.33,Chinese,,0,0,0,,让我以黑多多和Gillan在间隙即兴时的配合为例
Dialogue: 0,0:31:16.29,0:31:18.31,Chinese,,0,0,0,,吉他演奏，人声高亢，交织在一起，感觉就很......
Dialogue: 0,0:31:18.40,0:31:20.63,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Jon Lord和黑多多再配合
Dialogue: 0,0:31:23.92,0:31:27.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,那时我们的状态是最好的
Dialogue: 0,0:31:27.58,0:31:32.23,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们当时录制的专辑确实能代表我们的最高水平
Dialogue: 0,0:31:33.89,0:31:37.65,Chinese,,0,0,0,,黑多多会一直solo直到他不再想solo了
Dialogue: 0,0:31:37.65,0:31:40.09,Chinese,,0,0,0,,如果你注意的话，他转个头
Dialogue: 0,0:31:40.29,0:31:41.43,Chinese,,0,0,0,,伸出了他的右手
Dialogue: 0,0:31:41.68,0:31:44.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他看了一眼Ian Paice，然后Paice打四个小节
Dialogue: 0,0:31:44.74,0:31:46.13,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他们就进入下一部分了
Dialogue: 0,0:31:48.22,0:31:52.95,Chinese,,0,0,0,,要我说的话，这个乐队当时很火了，他们当时的状态是最好的
Dialogue: 0,0:31:53.48,0:31:54.59,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这就是为什么我很喜欢这张专辑
Dialogue: 0,0:31:55.57,0:32:03.20,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个是我们当时一起在晚上做现场演出时
Dialogue: 0,0:32:03.82,0:32:06.83,Chinese,,0,0,0,,互相配合，互相聆听
Dialogue: 0,0:32:07.18,0:32:10.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,一起演奏出美妙旋律的美妙画面
Dialogue: 0,0:32:11.30,0:32:15.21,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们回到英国后，把磁带放了一下
Dialogue: 0,0:32:18.83,0:32:19.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,听上去真不错
Dialogue: 0,0:32:22.10,0:32:23.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我想也许这个应该发行
Dialogue: 0,0:32:24.77,0:32:27.31,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在那时，我们在美国的发行商，华纳唱片公司
Dialogue: 0,0:32:27.38,0:32:28.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,对现场专辑并不感冒
Dialogue: 0,0:32:30.40,0:32:33.24,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他们很想发行我们的下一张专辑，Who Do We Think We Are
Dialogue: 0,0:32:35.13,0:32:39.23,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后呢，在那时我不认为咱们乐队能走得更远
Dialogue: 0,0:32:39.68,0:32:41.48,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你认为你的能力只能够录你的最后一张专辑了
Dialogue: 0,0:32:42.19,0:32:44.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是你要是幸运的话，你可以再得到几年的合同
Dialogue: 0,0:32:44.68,0:32:46.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后呢，谁知道呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:32:58.68,0:33:02.33,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Deep Purple 的金曲之一就在 Who Do We Think We Are
Dialogue: 0,0:33:03.41,0:33:04.24,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Woman From Tokyo
Dialogue: 0,0:33:04.57,0:33:07.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当时的情况十分困难
Dialogue: 0,0:33:10.41,0:33:13.03,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们已经做了In Rock，Fireball，Machine Head
Dialogue: 0,0:33:13.40,0:33:14.91,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后，就是这张Who Do We Think We Are
Dialogue: 0,0:33:15.26,0:33:16.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，我们之间更自闭了
Dialogue: 0,0:33:17.74,0:33:19.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,录制起来更加困难了
Dialogue: 0,0:33:19.30,0:33:21.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,也许这就是录制Who Do We Think We Are时最大的问题
Dialogue: 0,0:33:22.86,0:33:27.79,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们当时在罗马城外一个别墅录的
Dialogue: 0,0:33:27.99,0:33:31.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们觉得那个地方适合录音，就选了那里
Dialogue: 0,0:33:31.64,0:33:35.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是他们当时没有把拱道尺寸给测量出来
Dialogue: 0,0:33:35.86,0:33:38.53,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而拱道是用来过移动工作室的
Dialogue: 0,0:33:38.81,0:33:42.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,让其过来时容易些，可惜移动工作室尺寸和拱道的不相配:-(
Dialogue: 0,0:33:44.16,0:33:47.31,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以我们还得定制线缆，超级长的线缆:-(
Dialogue: 0,0:33:47.59,0:33:49.69,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们争吵不断，我们还录了张专辑
Dialogue: 0,0:34:02.81,0:34:06.79,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以说Made In Japan实际上就是Machine Head的配套
Dialogue: 0,0:34:07.46,0:34:09.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,如果我们要在Who Do We Think We Are发行后发行这个
Dialogue: 0,0:34:09.86,0:34:10.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,那这个就会过时了
Dialogue: 0,0:34:11.35,0:34:14.01,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以我们一定要在那时发行
Dialogue: 0,0:34:19.71,0:34:21.64,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他们最终发行了，但这是因为
Dialogue: 0,0:34:22.97,0:34:25.87,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们的管理层在往美国出口这张专辑
Dialogue: 0,0:34:26.97,0:34:30.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,华纳唱片公司最终意识到他们错过了一座大金山
Dialogue: 0,0:35:09.94,0:35:14.87,Chinese,,0,0,0,,说到Who Do We Think We Are，我觉得这张专辑不是那么好
Dialogue: 0,0:35:14.87,0:35:16.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,一开始录制时还行
Dialogue: 0,0:35:18.69,0:35:20.25,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是成员间开始离心
Dialogue: 0,0:35:21.00,0:35:24.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我认为当时黑多多和Gillan关系不是太好
Dialogue: 0,0:35:25.75,0:35:30.43,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后......后来的事情我就不明白了
Dialogue: 0,0:35:31.06,0:35:33.05,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是，当时他们之间的不满开始显现了
Dialogue: 0,0:35:33.19,0:35:38.83,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在录制Fireball和Who Do We Think We Are之间的某段时间
Dialogue: 0,0:35:39.43,0:35:41.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当然，这是贯穿整个Machine Head录制时段的
Dialogue: 0,0:35:42.74,0:35:47.39,Chinese,,0,0,0,,黑多多和Gillan两口子开始干架了
Dialogue: 0,0:35:49.08,0:35:52.87,Chinese,,0,0,0,,就这么发生了，我都不知道为啥
Dialogue: 0,0:35:52.87,0:35:58.33,Chinese,,0,0,0,,真的，我都不知道啥情况，他们两个在相同的事情
Dialogue: 0,0:35:59.22,0:36:02.75,Chinese,,0,0,0,,上天天争论，消磨了两人的关系，但是最终还是发生了什么
Dialogue: 0,0:36:14.32,0:36:18.75,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们已经在发展这种摇滚乐的事情上做了够多了
Dialogue: 0,0:36:18.89,0:36:19.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,就我目前所知道的
Dialogue: 0,0:36:21.34,0:36:24.41,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我认为我们的乐队各个成员天赋过剩
Dialogue: 0,0:36:21.34,0:36:24.41,Comments,,0,0,0,,注：Beatles and King Crimson 直呼内行
Dialogue: 0,0:36:24.67,0:36:26.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,很难保持现在的这个状态
Dialogue: 0,0:36:26.98,0:36:30.05,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我认为我们现在正在向自己妥协
Dialogue: 0,0:36:30.05,0:36:32.81,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我还认为我们没有了骨气（？）
Dialogue: 0,0:36:33.27,0:36:36.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我在1972决定退出乐队
Dialogue: 0,0:36:36.43,0:36:42.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,只是因为少年的迷茫和沮丧
Dialogue: 0,0:36:42.45,0:36:45.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,有很多没注意到的是，他不是被炒了，他是辞职了
Dialogue: 0,0:36:45.37,0:36:52.23,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他当时写了一封信，说他对目前乐队发展的方向
Dialogue: 0,0:36:52.51,0:36:54.30,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不太赞同
Dialogue: 0,0:36:54.88,0:36:58.31,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我必须说，我真心认为
Dialogue: 0,0:36:59.34,0:37:01.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,要是我们的经纪人们能够理解
Dialogue: 0,0:37:01.59,0:37:02.89,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他是在寻求理解和帮助的话
Dialogue: 0,0:37:03.48,0:37:05.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他大概就不会离开乐队的吧
Dialogue: 0,0:37:06.18,0:37:10.39,Chinese,,0,0,0,,可是真的，这封信改变了一切
Dialogue: 0,0:37:06.18,0:37:10.39,Comments,,0,0,0,,Google机器翻译：往锅里扔了一些东西来改变配方。
Dialogue: 0,0:37:10.83,0:37:11.81,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我不知道这是怎么了
Dialogue: 0,0:37:12.64,0:37:16.87,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但很明显，这个Deep Purple不是我在1969年加入的Deep Purple了
Dialogue: 0,0:37:17.83,0:37:20.91,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这不是以前那个乐队了，你很快就会认为......怎么说呢
Dialogue: 0,0:37:21.34,0:37:23.41,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我一直都是基于
Dialogue: 0,0:37:24.07,0:37:25.55,Chinese,,0,0,0,,“我干这件事情是不是高兴”的原则来做决定的
Dialogue: 0,0:37:26.45,0:37:28.35,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我不知道该怎么办，所以我退出乐队了
Dialogue: 0,0:37:29.45,0:37:34.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在那时我很伤心，完全不知道该怎么办。我当时就
Dialogue: 0,0:37:35.24,0:37:37.97,Chinese,,0,0,0,,尽管黑多多和Gillan俩口子经常吵架
Dialogue: 0,0:37:39.83,0:37:41.30,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我还是觉得我们是一个十分成功的大乐队
Dialogue: 0,0:37:54.91,0:37:56.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,乐队里面，我们当时觉得
Dialogue: 0,0:37:56.84,0:37:57.92,Chinese,,0,0,0,,黑多多也要离开
Dialogue: 0,0:37:58.80,0:37:59.89,Chinese,,0,0,0,,还要拉上Paice
Dialogue: 0,0:38:01.13,0:38:03.59,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Gillan 写完辞职信后
Dialogue: 0,0:38:04.93,0:38:05.95,Chinese,,0,0,0,,那就只剩下Jon Lord和我了
Dialogue: 0,0:38:09.74,0:38:10.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,黑多多是那种
Dialogue: 0,0:38:10.80,0:38:12.89,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我个人认为，是一个十分喜欢追寻新奇东西的人
Dialogue: 0,0:38:14.20,0:38:18.85,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而且，我们当时还不知道的是
Dialogue: 0,0:38:19.05,0:38:20.58,Chinese,,0,0,0,,黑多多正和Thin Lizzy的Phil Lynott秘密Jamming
Dialogue: 0,0:38:19.05,0:38:20.58,Comments,,0,0,0,,注：Jam 即即兴演奏，一般是用来磨合关系并创作旋律的
Dialogue: 0,0:38:21.18,0:38:22.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我想他应该是想写三组音乐片段吧
Dialogue: 0,0:38:27.39,0:38:31.40,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我当时想和Thin Lizzy的Phil Lynott组队
Dialogue: 0,0:38:32.17,0:38:36.49,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我和Ian Paice说：“咱们来写三组音乐片段
Dialogue: 0,0:38:36.74,0:38:41.01,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后......咱来点Hendrix味的蓝调"
Dialogue: 0,0:38:59.41,0:39:02.17,Chinese,,0,0,0,,一天晚上，我们乐队的两个经纪人，Tony Edwards和John Coletta
Dialogue: 0,0:39:02.95,0:39:07.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,把 Jon Lord 和我叫到伦敦的一个餐馆，并且说
Dialogue: 0,0:39:09.08,0:39:09.85,Chinese,,0,0,0,,”现在情况太疯狂了！
Dialogue: 0,0:39:10.78,0:39:11.41,Chinese,,0,0,0,,乐队正在分崩离析
Dialogue: 0,0:39:11.61,0:39:13.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,可你们现在是全世界最大，最成功的乐队啊！
Dialogue: 0,0:39:16.61,0:39:18.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,也许你们能说服Paice留在乐队
Dialogue: 0,0:39:18.82,0:39:21.21,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后咱再找个新的主唱和吉他手来继续咱们的事业。”
Dialogue: 0,0:39:22.82,0:39:26.81,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这对我们而言，就......太难以理解了，对吧？
Dialogue: 0,0:39:28.95,0:39:30.65,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们答应道：“好吧，咱先这么干。”
Dialogue: 0,0:39:30.99,0:39:35.27,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后，我们的第一件事是，我们俩去说服Paice留在乐队
Dialogue: 0,0:39:35.30,0:39:39.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在那时Ian Paice有点让人难以理解
Dialogue: 0,0:39:39.90,0:39:40.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他说：你想想
Dialogue: 0,0:39:41.94,0:39:45.28,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你要是留在Deep Purple，那该多好啊
Dialogue: 0,0:39:45.76,0:39:49.67,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Ian Gillan虽然走了，但是乐队本身没有什么问题啊
Dialogue: 0,0:39:49.87,0:39:51.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你为何不留在Deep Purple呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:39:51.36,0:39:53.93,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我说：那行
Dialogue: 0,0:39:55.13,0:39:58.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,只要Roger Glover离开就行
Dialogue: 0,0:39:58.89,0:40:01.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因为我对他的风格不太满意
Dialogue: 0,0:39:55.13,0:40:01.62,Comments,,0,0,0,,注：我觉得黑多多就是把对Gillan的气都撒在了Glover上，没有想过归队的事情
Dialogue: 0,0:40:02.80,0:40:05.30,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他说：这不公平啊，Roger并没有做错什么啊
Dialogue: 0,0:40:02.80,0:40:05.30,Comments,,0,0,0,,注：个人认为他口误了，应该是Paice说的
Dialogue: 0,0:40:06.55,0:40:07.65,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你这话说着，让我都想要离队
Dialogue: 0,0:40:08.37,0:40:12.53,Chinese,,0,0,0,,找点别的事情干而不是把什么也没做错的人给开除了
Dialogue: 0,0:40:13.28,0:40:18.10,Chinese,,0,0,0,,接下来，记得是1973年1月，我们在北欧巡演
Dialogue: 0,0:40:18.85,0:40:20.69,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们演出后在换衣室叫住了Paice，跟他说
Dialogue: 0,0:40:20.69,0:40:24.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,听着，跟我们在一起吧。我们回来再找个主唱和吉他手
Dialogue: 0,0:40:25.47,0:40:26.55,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他当时说他正在考虑
Dialogue: 0,0:40:26.84,0:40:29.03,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你们得先了解一点，我当时的思维和小孩子无异
Dialogue: 0,0:40:29.30,0:40:32.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我当时就像糖果店里的孩子，生活就像是个很大的派对
Dialogue: 0,0:40:32.34,0:40:34.27,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我对接下来发生的事情完全不知
Dialogue: 0,0:40:34.68,0:40:35.95,Chinese,,0,0,0,,明天会怎样啊，下一场演出会如何啊
Dialogue: 0,0:40:36.95,0:40:40.93,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我当时认为这些事应该由黑多多和Jon Lord考虑
Dialogue: 0,0:40:41.68,0:40:43.93,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因为这和我想的人生道路不太一样
Dialogue: 0,0:40:44.31,0:40:48.45,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们在日本巡演了一次，然后是美国的两次
Dialogue: 0,0:40:51.39,0:40:54.33,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后，在第二次美国巡演的时候我意识到
Dialogue: 0,0:40:56.59,0:40:57.45,Chinese,,0,0,0,,没人跟我说话了:-(
Dialogue: 0,0:41:27.97,0:41:31.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Ian Paice说：好的，你要留下来的话，我们就把Roger给炒了
Dialogue: 0,0:41:32.68,0:41:34.61,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当时我挺秃然的
Dialogue: 0,0:41:32.68,0:41:37.88,Comments,,0,0,0,,黑多多：我就是一句气话，结果我不光害了Glover，我还得归队:-(
Dialogue: 0,0:41:35.05,0:41:37.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我当时说：“......好吧”
Dialogue: 0,0:41:38.95,0:41:41.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我当时感觉很不好，就好像孙悟空被唐僧赶了出去
Dialogue: 0,0:41:43.36,0:41:45.55,Chinese,,0,0,0,,可是我没有花果山啊，我都不知道该咋办了
Dialogue: 0,0:41:45.99,0:41:47.31,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们当时在佛罗里达的Jacksonville
Dialogue: 0,0:41:48.74,0:41:50.79,Chinese,,0,0,0,,回到我们下榻的旅馆
Dialogue: 0,0:41:51.51,0:41:54.41,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我敲开了Tony Edward的门，我们当时的经纪人
Dialogue: 0,0:41:54.57,0:41:56.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他问：“来此贵干？”我反问：“现在是什么状况？”
Dialogue: 0,0:41:57.04,0:41:58.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他说：“一切照常。”
Dialogue: 0,0:41:59.16,0:42:00.48,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我反驳道：“现在暗流涌动”
Dialogue: 0,0:42:01.45,0:42:03.19,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他否定地说：不是，真的一切照常
Dialogue: 0,0:42:04.26,0:42:06.42,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我说：好的，除非你跟我说实话，否则我就在此赖上了
Dialogue: 0,0:42:09.02,0:42:11.45,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他只好挑明了：好吧，他们想让你离队
Dialogue: 0,0:42:14.80,0:42:18.05,Chinese,,0,0,0,,“什么？”他接着说：“我也不知道为啥，但就是这样
Dialogue: 0,0:42:18.05,0:42:21.61,Chinese,,0,0,0,,黑多多同意留队，条件是你
Dialogue: 0,0:42:21.61,0:42:22.30,Chinese,,0,0,0,,必须离队
Dialogue: 0,0:42:26.95,0:42:27.97,Chinese,,0,0,0,,听上去确实很难受
Dialogue: 0,0:42:45.61,0:42:47.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,也许我真干错了什么，但是我还是说：
Dialogue: 0,0:42:49.23,0:42:50.17,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好吧，你不会开除我的
Dialogue: 0,0:42:50.68,0:42:53.42,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我坚持站好我的最后一班岗，然后我自行离开
Dialogue: 0,0:42:54.24,0:42:55.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,为啥他们之前没跟我说呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:42:57.20,0:42:59.02,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他们说：因为我们要完成巡演
Dialogue: 0,0:42:59.28,0:43:00.99,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们不想让你在巡演半途就离队
Dialogue: 0,0:43:03.20,0:43:07.02,Chinese,,0,0,0,,他们真是够该死的，我当时想。“我当然会尽我的职责，我会
Dialogue: 0,0:43:07.99,0:43:09.85,Chinese,,0,0,0,,很绅士地处理这些问题，我干完活就走
