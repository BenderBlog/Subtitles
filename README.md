Special in English: Why I have to write my own license? 

>My subtitles was originally dual-licensed under CC0 License and the Anti-996 License. However, In case someone use my subtitle which makes me unhappy, I wrote this License. An inspiration from two things: 
> 
>    1. The translation of the 8-bit-guy videos was originally by Woodear85@Bilibli (now paizhangpi@Bilibili) with the permisson of David Murray, original producer of the 8-bit-guy videos. In the mid May 2020, a subtitle group took over the translation of the 8-bit-guy videos with the permisson of David Murray (I think he had forgot he had given a permission to Woodear85@Bilibli). The quality of the translation by the new tranlation group was very terrible due to the heavy use of the machine translation. 
>    Almost all fans dislike the new translation group and after some discussion between Woodear85, the new translation group, and David Murray, the permission had transfered back to Woodear85. 
>    Since Woodear himself is busy with his daily life, and he did not have enough time to translate video. But he is one of the people who lead me into the world of translation. Here, I salute him. 
> 
>    2. The Chubbyemu videos (produced by Dr. Bernard Hsu) are translated by the "C7 translation group(第七颈椎字幕组)", estabished by David_lai(who controlled the original Bilibili branch of the Chubbyemu channed, called RealChubbyemu). During the beginning of 2021, David_lai forbade everyone in the C7 subtitle group and Dr. Hsu accessing the RealChubbyemu account. And take the money in the RealChubbyemu account away. Now Dr. Hsu premitted C7 subtitle group to translate Chubbyemu video and publish them in the new Bilibili branch. 
> 
>I would not gain anything from making these subtitles, except for the improvement of my English. (But I still make so many spell mistake and misuse of the past tense, etc lol) But I also don't want them fall into the wrong hand. Also, I am a student, I am busy with schoolwork, so I don't have much time dealing with permission stuff and money-related things. (Yes, you may gain profits in Bilibili, but not much. fpsluozi only gain 900 RMB from translating ElectroBOOM with the permission from Mehdi Sadaghdar.) So when I successfully contact Clint Basigner(LGR) himself, I didn't ask for permission, but a open cheque to let everyone upload his video with proper translation and his 'LGR' mark instead. 
> 
>I know this license would be close to useless due to the evil people in marketing accounts, and I think the permitted translators would not spare a glance for my subtitles. But I still need to write them. After all, it is way better than CC0+Anti996 Dual License because at least it express my idea.
